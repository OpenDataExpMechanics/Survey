Title = {{Effect of core-shell rubber (CSR) nano-particles on mechanical
   properties and fracture toughness of an epoxy polymer}},
Journal = {{POLYMER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{66}},
Pages = {{16-28}},

Abstract = {{A DGEBA epoxy resin cured using dicyandiamide hardener, was modified by
   using two types of CSR nano-particles over a range of volume fractions
   from 0 vol.\% to 38 vol.\%. The size and microstructure of CSR particles
   were studied and the measured diameters are 203 nm (with a 16.9 nm shell
   thickness) and 74.1 nm respectively. Addition of CSR nano particles
   increased the glass transition temperature due to the interaction
   between matrix and particles. Addition of CSR particles increased the
   ductility and Poisson's ratio of epoxy, but reduced the Young's modulus
   and tensile strength. Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio and tensile
   strength were well predicted by theoretical models using an effective
   volume fraction of rubber. An optimum CSR content was found to exist,
   when the fracture energy increased from 343 J/m(2) for matrix to 2671
   J/m(2) for epoxy modified by 30 vol.\% of CSR particles, and then
   started to decline. The main toughening mechanisms were proved to be
   debonding of CSR particles from matrix, followed by plastic voids
   growth, which was accompanied by shear bands yielding. Large-scale
   plastic void growth was discovered at the subcritical tip of double
   notch four points bending test (DN-4PB), and the values of fracture
   energy were found to be proportional to the size of plastic damage zone
   measured from subcritical crack tip of DN-4PB. This proved the plastic
   void growth is the major toughening mechanism, which correlated well
   with the results of fracture energy modelling. A theoretical model was
   used to predict the fracture toughness increment due to the shear band
   yielding and plastic void growth. The analytical values showed good
   agreement with the experimental data, and further demonstrated the
   proposed toughening mechanism. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The effect of stress state and loading path on the ductile fracture of
   aluminum 2024-T351 is characterized through tension-torsion experiments
   on tubular specimens. The experimental program includes proportional and
   non-proportional loading paths leading to the onset of fracture at
   nearly plane stress conditions at stress triaxialities between 0 and
   0.6. Stereo digital image correlation is used to measure the
   displacements and rotations applied to the specimen shoulders. An
   isotropic non-quadratic Hosford plasticity model with combined
   Voce-Swift hardening is used to obtain estimates of the local stress and
   strain fields within the specimen gage section. The hybrid
   experimental-numerical results indicate a higher strain to fracture for
   pure shear than for uniaxial tension. The calibration of a
   Hosford-Coulomb fracture initiation model suggests that the ductility of
   aluminum 2024-T351 decreases monotonically as a function of the stress
   triaxiality, whereas it is a non-symmetric convex function of the Lode
   angle parameter. It is shown that a simple non-linear damage
   accumulation rule can describe the effect of non-proportional loading on
   the strain to fracture. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Rail tread oblique crack, initiated by rolling contact fatigue (RCF)
   damage, is one of the most significant phenomena and has serious
   influence on rail industry. Electromagnetic non-destructive testing (EM
   NDT) methods are usually used in rail regular inspection. However, the
   conventional EM NDT methods based on eddy current field distribution are
   difficult to detect the cracks parallel to the inductive coil (parallel
   cracks) and natural oblique cracks. This paper studied lateral heat
   conduction (LHC) induced by eddy current for detection of these defects.
   The proposed method was verified through both numerical and experimental
   studies as well as the investigation of characteristic of LHC. Due to
   significant temperature gradient in the direction of lateral heat
   conduction, the spatial derivative and gradient were proposed to improve
   the defect detectability on the thermo-grams. Finally, the test of
   natural oblique cracks on a rail was conducted to validate the proposed
   methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study atomic force microscopy (AFM) creep indentations were
   performed to extract viscoelastic properties of the different domains
   (defined as microrheology) observed in bitumen samples from two
   different sources. The microrheology and geometry obtained using the AFM
   were used to perform finite element (FE) simulations to study the effect
   of bitumen microstructure on internal stress distribution. FE analyses
   suggest that microstructures with varying mechanical properties cause
   localised stress amplification that can lead to cracking/phase
   separation. A custom-made loading frame in conjunction with an AFM was
   used to examine the effects of tensile strain on bitumen microstructure.
   FE simulation and experimental results show that applying strain
   resulted in damage/phase separation concentrated in the interstitial
   zone between neighbouring bee structures, defined as load-induced phase
   separation. This study suggests that evaluating the bitumen
   microstructure and microrheology is critical to understanding the
   mechanisms of damage evolution in bitumen and engineering binders with

Title = {{Effect of grinding wheel spindle vibration on surface roughness and
   subsurface damage in brittle material grinding}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS \& MANUFACTURE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{12-23}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The external interference and vibration can seriously affect the
   machining errors in brittle materials grinding process. This paper
   proposes a new model to analyze the relationship between surface
   roughness (SR) and subsurface damage (SSD) depth on the basis of
   grinding kinematics analysis and indentation fracture mechanics of
   brittle materials taking the wheel spindle vibration into account. The
   basic equations, for example, equations of grain trajectory and
   penetration depth are derived in new forms. Based on the basic equations
   above, the existing SR and SSD formulae are modified for further study.
   The effects of grinding and vibration parameters on SR and SSD are
   respectively analyzed in detail. Results show that both SR and SSD
   increase with the increase of table speed and vibration amplitude
   resulting in bad surface and subsurface quality. On the other hand, both
   the increasing grinding speed and decreasing vibration frequency can
   improve the quality of ground surface and subsurface with small SR and
   SSD. In addition, the increase of initial grinding depth and vibration
   initial phase increase the depth of SSD but have little effect on SR.
   The penetration depth and distance between grain's tip and finished
   surface are the two main factors considered to cause the different
   effect laws on SR and SSD among these parameters. Experiment is carried
   out to validate the rationality of proposed model. The effect trends of
   various grinding parameters on SR obtained by our model consist with
   measured experimental data. The typical subsurface crack system is
   clearly revealed through the experimental observation on SSD using SEM.
   Finally, the relationship between the two is fitted utilizing quadratic
   polynomial. Results show that the SSD depth is nonlinear monotone
   increasing with SR and the fitting accuracy is more or less affected by
   both grinding and vibration parameters. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Determination of minimum CFRP pre-stress levels for fatigue crack
   prevention in retrofitted metallic beams}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{84}},
Pages = {{29-41}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{The majority of fatigue strengthening studies focus on reducing
   propagation rates of existing cracks, ignoring the crack initiation
   stage. Many existing metallic bridge members however do not contain
   existing cracks, but rather are nearing their design fatigue life.
   Limited research exists on the prevention of crack initiation using
   carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) materials. In this paper,
   constant life diagrams (CLDs) are used to determine the minimum level of
   CFRP pre-stress required to indefinitely extend the fatigue life of
   existing metallic beams. It is shown that by applying a compressive
   force to an existing fatigue-susceptible detail using pre-stressed CFRP
   plates, the mean stress level can be reduced such that the detail is
   shifted from the `finite life' regime to the `infinite life' regime. The
   proposed fatigue strengthening approach is advantageous particularly
   when the stress history from the prior traffic loadings is not known. To
   validate the proposed method, a pre-stressed un-bonded CFRP
   reinforcement system is introduced and tested on four metallic beams.
   The proposed un-bonded CFRP system is advantageous over traditional
   bonded CFRP systems as it can be applied to rough or obstructed surfaces
   (surfaces containing rivet heads or corrosion pitting for example).
   Additionally, the new un-bonded CFRP system offers a fast on-site
   installation (no glue and surface preparation are required) and an
   adaptive pre-stress level. Experimental results show that strengthening
   using pre-stressed CFRP plates are capable of shifting the working
   stresses from a finite fatigue-life zone to an infinite fatigue-life
   zone preventing crack initiation. Although according to many structural
   standards, the stress range is the main parameter that affects the
   fatigue life of a metallic detail, the results of this study clearly
   show that the mean stress level also plays a significant rule in the
   detail fatigue life. Based on the proposed CLD approach in this paper,
   the combined effects of the stress range and mean stress level can be
   taken into account for prediction of fatigue life of metallic members.

Abstract = {{Underwater laser ablation has become an alternative machining process
   that is able to reduce the thermal damage in work materials caused by
   lasers. However, the disturbance of water to the laser beam is a crucial
   concern for the ablation performance in water and cut surface quality
   obtained. In this study, a new laser ablation technique has been
   proposed, in which a waterjet was applied to impinge the top workpiece
   surface in order to form a thin and flowing water layer. With the assist
   of such water layer during the laser ablation, the redeposition and
   heat-affected zone can be minimized. Titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) selected
   as a work sample was grooved by using a nanosecond-pulse laser under
   different machining conditions. The cut geometry and heat-affected zone
   were observed and analyzed to justify the process performance. The
   metallurgical change and cracks that occurred on and underneath the
   groove surface were also investigated in this study. The experimental
   results revealed that a clean cut with less thermal damage can be
   obtained when the workpiece was ablated by a laser under the flowing
   water layer. In addition, a narrower and deeper groove can be fabricated
   when a higher waterjet flow rate was applied. The laser ablation under
   the flowing water layer developed in this study could be a potential
   method for machining titanium alloy or even other thermal-sensitive
   materials. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   SiC ceramic under impact}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{76}},
Pages = {{9-19}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Silicon carbide ceramics are generally used in armour configurations for
   the foot-soldier or military vehicles. However, their behaviour during
   impact is not fully understood. In this work, the dynamic fragmentation
   of silicon carbide has been characterised through different impact
   configurations: Edge-on impact tests and normal impact tests have been
   conducted in open and sarcophagus configuration. In the first
   configuration, an ultra-high speed camera is used to visualise the
   fragmentation process with an interframe time set to 1 pis. The
   sarcophagus configuration provides a post-mortem view of the damage
   pattern. Moreover, a comparison with numerical results given by an
   anisotropic damage model shows a good capacity to predict the damage
   patterns and the cracking densities of the ceramic after impact but also
   the damage kinetics observed during impact. In addition, an original
   impact configuration is proposed for characterising the dynamic
   behaviour of a pre-fragmented ceramic. The tests have been compared to
   experiments performed with a plane aluminium alloy target. The results
   underline the good penetration resistance of the fragmented ceramic. (C)

Title = {{Prediction of fretting fatigue crack initiation in double lap bolted
   joint using Continuum Damage Mechanics}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{66-76}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In fretting fatigue, the combination of small oscillatory motion, normal
   pressure and cyclic axial loading develops a noticeable stress
   concentration at the contact zone leading to accumulation of damage in
   fretted region, which produces micro cracks, and consequently forms a
   leading crack that can lead to failure. In fretting fatigue experiments,
   it is very difficult to detect the crack initiation phase. Damages and
   cracks are always hidden between the counterpart surfaces. Therefore,
   numerical modeling techniques for analyzing fretting fatigue crack
   initiation provide a precious tool to study this phenomenon. This
   article gives an insight in fretting fatigue crack initiation. This is
   done by means of an experimental set up and numerical models developed
   with the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software package ABAQUS. Using
   Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) approach in conjunction with FEA, an
   uncoupled damage evolution law is used to model fretting fatigue crack
   initiation lifetime of Double Bolted Lap Joint (DBLJ). The predicted
   fatigue lifetimes are in good agreement with the experimentally measured
   ones. This comparison provides insight to the contribution of damage
   initiation and crack propagation in the total fatigue lifetime of DBLJ
   test specimens. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},
