Abstract = {{Self-healing materials are attracting increasing interest of the
   research community, over the last decades, due to their efficiency in
   detecting and ``autonomically{''} healing damage. Numerous attempts are
   being presented every year focusing on the development of different
   self-healing systems as well as their integration to large scale
   production With the best possible property cost relationship. The
   current work aims to present the most recent breakthroughs in these
   attempts from many different research groups published during the last
   five years. The current review focuses in polymeric systems and their
   composites. The reviewed literature is presented in three distinct
   categories, based on three different scopes of interest. These
   categories are (i) the materials and systems employed, (ii) the
   experimental techniques for the evaluation of materials properties and
   self-healing efficiency of the materials/structures and (iii) the
   characterization techniques utilized in order to evaluate (off-line) and
   monitor (on-line) the healing efficiency of the proposed systems.
   Published works are presented separately in all the different
   categories, thus the interested reader is advised to follow the
   structure of the review and refer to the chapter of interest. (C) 2015

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A numerical model describing the evolution of ductile damage was
   developed to predict the onset of fracture during the clinch joining of
   thin aluminium AA6082-T6 sheets. The damage model was calibrated and
   validated using instrumented punch-out tests in order to increase the
   reliability and robustness of the damage parameter. An inverse analysis
   was performed (by varying the damage parameter) by minimizing the
   difference between the experimental and numerical prediction concerning
   the load-stroke curves and the geometries of punched cross-sections.
   Then, a numerical model of mechanical clinching using the damage
   parameter was developed and compared with experimental clinched
   connections. The results show that the model enables the onset of cracks
   in critical regions to be predicted. The critical regions are the
   punch-sided sheet neck and die-sided sheet bulge. The established
   numerical model of clinching provides a viable means for optimizing the
   geometry of the clinching tools so as to improve the mechanical
   behaviour of the joints (by maximizing the undercut and reducing the
   neck thinning) other than preventing the onset of cracks on the joints.

Title = {{Failure of metals III: Fracture and fatigue of nanostructured metallic
   materials}},
Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{107}},
Pages = {{508-544}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Pushing the internal or external dimensions of metallic alloys down to
   the nanometer scale gives rise to strong materials, though most often at
   the expense of a low ductility and a low resistance to cracking, with
   negative impact on the transfer to engineering applications. These
   characteristics are observed, with some exceptions, in bulk ultra-fine
   grained and nanocrystalline metals, nano-twinned metals, thin metallic
   coatings on substrates and freestanding thin metallic films and
   nanowires. This overview encompasses all these systems to reveal
   commonalities in the origins of the lack of ductility and fracture
   resistance, in factors governing fatigue resistance, and in ways to
   improve properties. After surveying the various processing methods and
   key deformation mechanisms, we systematically address the current state
   of the art in terms of plastic localization, damage, static and fatigue
   cracking, for three classes of systems: (1) bulk ultra-fine grained and
   nanocrystalline metals, (2) thin metallic films on substrates, and (3)
   1D and 2D freestanding micro and nanoscale systems. In doing so, we aim
   to favour cross-fertilization between progress made in the fields of
   mechanics of thin films, nanomechanics, fundamental researches in bulk
   nanocrystalline metals and metallurgy to impart enhanced resistance to
   fracture and fatigue in high-strength nanostructured systems. This
   involves exploiting intrinsic mechanisms, e.g. to enhance hardening and
   rate-sensitivity so as to delay necking, or improve grain-boundary
   cohesion to resist intergranular cracks or voids. Extrinsic methods can
   also be utilized such as by hybridizing the metal with another material
   to delocalize the deformation - as practiced in stretchable electronics.
   Fatigue crack initiation is in principle improved by a fine structure,
   but at the expense of larger fatigue crack growth rates. Extrinsic
   toughening through hybridization allows arresting or bridging cracks.
   The content and discussions are based on experimental, theoretical and
   simulation results from the recent literature, and focus is laid on
   linking microstructure and physical mechanisins to the overall
   mechanical behavior. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier

Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{214-220}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{This study investigates the effect of adding different types of fibers
   on the microstructure and the mechanical behavior of cementitious
   composites, in particular on UHPC. These fibers were distinguished
   mainly by their differing nature (steel, mineral and synthetic), their
   dimensions (macroscopic or microscopic), and their mechanical
   properties. The microstructure of the specimens was examined by using
   SEM observation and by measuring the porosity, the intrinsic
   permeability and the P-wave velocity. The mechanical behavior under
   loading has been studied using a uni-axial compression test which
   combines the gas permeability and the acoustic emission (AE)
   measurement. This work focuses on the cracking process under mechanical
   loading. The experimental results show that the fiber has a relatively
   slight influence on the compressive strength and elastic modulus of
   concrete, except for the steel fiber which improves the strength because
   of its intrinsic rigidity. However, The addition of fiber significantly
   reduces the lateral strain at peak loading and increases the threshold
   of initial cracking (sigma(k-ci)) and that of unstable cracking
   (sigma(k-pi)). Therefore, the fibers clearly restrain the cracking
   process in concrete under the mechanic loading. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) used in gas-turbine engines experience
   severe degradation by calciamagnesia-alumino-silicate (CMAS) deposits
   during high-temperature operation. The present study identified and
   evaluated the chemical and microstructural changes in air plasma-sprayed
   (APS) 7 wt.\% Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 (7YSZ) TBCs caused by CMAS attack
   under isothermal conditions at 1340 degrees C. Additionally, a `model'
   experimental study was conducted by characterizing 7YSZ ceramic powders
   immersed in molten CMAS glass at 1300 degrees C for different exposure
   times. The combined results from both studies highlight the importance
   of local CMAS glass composition on the 7YSZ/CMAS interaction.
   Specifically, low Y-content in the glass, caused by a relatively large
   glass `sink,' produces Y-depleted ZrO2 grains that undergo tetragonal
   (t) -> monoclinic (m) phase transformation upon cooling. Alternatively,
   small pockets of Y-enriched glass induce the formation of t `'-ZrO2, a
   phase characterized by its high stabilizer content. After prolonged
   high-temperature exposure, solution-reprecipitation induces the
   formation of both m-ZrO2 and t `'-ZrO2 throughout the APS 7YSZ TBC in
   accordance with the phase diagram. Using a thermomechanical model it is
   shown that the strain associated with the martensitic t -> m phase
   transformation plays an important role in the delamination failure of
   TBCs attacked by CMAS. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{The acoustic emission (AE) is a powerful and potential nondestructive
   testing method for structural monitoring in civil engineering. Here, we
   show how systematic investigation of crack phenomena based on AE data
   can be significantly improved by the use of advanced signal processing
   techniques. Such data are a fundamental source of information that can
   be used as the basis for evaluating the status of the material, thereby
   paving the way for a new frontier of innovation made by data-enabled
   analytics. In this article, we propose a framework based on the
   Hilbert-Huang Transform for the evaluation of material damages that (i)
   facilitates the systematic employment of both established and promising
   analysis criteria, and (ii) provides unsupervised tools to achieve an
   accurate classification of the fracture type, the discrimination between
   longitudinal (P-) and traversal (S-) waves related to an AE event. The
   experimental validation shows promising results for a reliable
   assessment of the health status through the monitoring of civil
   infrastructures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Failure of metals II: Fatigue}},
Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{107}},
Pages = {{484-507}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{In this interpretive review, fatigue in metallic systems is considered
   primarily from the perspective of interactions between the
   microstructure, the deformation mode and the mechanical state at both
   low and high temperatures. In Part 1 the development and early
   propagation of cracks is considered in terms of the basic damage
   mechanisms and the relative size of the crack with respect to applicable
   micro structural feature(s). In this section, a multistage grain scale
   approach to microstructure-sensitive fatigue crack formation and growth
   is presented which uses Fatigue Indicator Parameters (FIPs) to correlate
   these processes. Various FIPs parameters are discussed in terms of their
   indication of the state of fatigue. The development and early crack
   propagation is considered in the context of microstructure and notches,
   and probabilistic aspects of the notch fatigue problem are discussed.
   These features are integrated into a systematic approach for the
   selection of fatigue resistant microstructures for given applications.
   In Part 2, attention is focused on Ni-base superalloys and the
   interaction between oxidation, creep and microstructure (including
   coatings) in the formation and propagation of cracks. This part of the
   overview addresses both experimental and modelling aspects.
   Methodologies based upon fundamental physical processes are presented
   for understanding and predicting the development and propagation of
   fatigue cracks, including effects of sequential oxide type formation and
   of creep on either restraining or accelerating damage by oxidation. The
   variable fatigue resistance of discs in jet engines is seen to depend
   upon the variability of microstructure and its influence on the severity
   of creep oxidation interactions. All of these factors are considered in
   the practical case where both temperature and loading parameters vary
   simultaneously (thermomechanical fatigue). A physics-based life
   prediction model considering the interactions of deformation and
   environmental damage is reviewed in terms of its applicability to life
   prediction of components. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

   assisted cracking}},
Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{117}},
Pages = {{321-332}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Finite element analysis of stress about a blunt crack tip, emphasizing
   finite strain and phenomenological and mechanism-based strain gradient
   plasticity (SGP) formulations, is integrated with electrochemical
   assessment of occluded-crack tip hydrogen (H) solubility and two
   H-decohesion models to predict hydrogen environment assisted crack
   growth properties. SGP elevates crack tip geometrically necessary
   dislocation density and flow stress, with enhancement declining with
   increasing alloy strength. Elevated hydrostatic stress promotes
   high-trapped H concentration for crack tip damage; it is imperative to
   account for SGP in H cracking models. Predictions of the threshold
   stress intensity factor and H-diffusion limited Stage II crack growth
   rate agree with experimental data for a high strength austenitic Ni-Cu
   superalloy (Monel (R) K-500) and two modern ultra-high strength
   martensitic steels (AerMet (TM) 100 and Ferrium (TM) M54) stressed in
   0.6 M NaCl solution over a range of applied potential. For Monel (R)
   K-500, K-TH is accurately predicted versus cathodic potential using
   either classical or gradient-modified formulations; however, Stage II
   growth rate is best predicted by a SGP description of crack tip stress
   that justifies a critical distance of 1 mu m. For steel, threshold and
   growth rate are best predicted using high-hydrostatic stress that
   exceeds 6 to 8 times alloy yield strength and extends 1 mu m ahead of
   the crack tip. This stress is nearly achieved with a three-length
   phenomenological SGP formulation, but additional stress enhancement is
   needed, perhaps due to tip geometry or slip-microstructure. (C) 2016

Title = {{Effect of loading rates on pullout behavior of high strength steel
   fibers embedded in ultra-high performance concrete}},
Journal = {{CEMENT \& CONCRETE COMPOSITES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{98-109}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In this paper single fiber pull-out performance of high strength steel
   fibers embedded in ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) is
   investigated. The research emphasis is placed on the experimental
   performance at various pullout rates to better understand the dynamic
   tensile behavior of ultra-high performance fiber reinforced concrete
   (UHP-FRC). Based on the knowledge that crack formation is strain rate
   sensitive, it is hypothesized that the formation of micro-splitting
   cracks and the damage of cement-based matrix in the fiber tunnel are
   mainly attributing to the rate sensitivity. Hereby, different pull-out
   mechanisms of straight and mechanically bonded fibers will be examined
   more closely. The experimental investigation considers four types of
   high strength steel fibers as follows: straight smooth brass-coated with
   a diameter of 0.2 mm and 038 mm, half end hooked with a diameter of 0.38
   mm and twisted fibers with an equivalent diameter of 03 mm. Four
   different pull out loading rates were applied ranging from 0.025 mm/s to
   25 mm/s. The loading rate effects on maximum fiber tensile stress, use
   of material, pullout energy, equivalent bond strength, and average bond
   strength are characterized and analyzed. The test results indicate that
   half-hooked fibers exhibit highest loading rate sensitivity of all
   fibers used in this research, which might be attributed to potential
   matrix split cracking. Furthermore, the effect of fiber embedment angles
   on the loading rate sensitivity of fiber pullout behavior is
   investigated. Three fiber embedment angles, 0 degrees, 20 degrees, and
   45 degrees, are considered. The results reveal that there is a
   correlation between fiber embedment angle and loading rate sensitivity
   of fiber pullout behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Automotive laminated glass is normally comprised of two soda-lime glass
   sheets bonded with one plastic interlayer, polyvinyl butyral (PVB).
   Glass-ply cracking is the principal damage pattern in PVB laminated
   glass under low-velocity impact. The purpose of this work is to
   numerically investigate the glass-ply cracking mechanism in the
   framework of cohesive zone modelling. Toward this end, the glass-ply
   cracking is modelled via an extrinsic cohesive model. Besides, a
   laminated glass model is proposed, in which brick elements are adopted
   and an intrinsic cohesive formulation is employed to model the adhesion
   between glass and PVB. The nonlinear characteristic of PVB is described
   by using a Mooney-Rivlin constitutive model. Then, the glass-ply
   cracking behaviours of a laminated glass beam under drop-weight impact
   are simulated. The proposed approach is qualitatively validated by
   comparing the simulation results with the experimental observations. In
   the simulation, the propagations of stress waves of the laminated glass
   beam during the crack process are illustrated, and the glass-ply
   cracking mechanism is revealed. Finally, the effects of the PVB film and
   the adhesion on glass-ply cracking are investigated. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Month = {{FEB 6}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we review analytical and computational models of bone
   fracture and strength. Bone fracture is a complex phenomenon due to the
   composite, inhomogeneous and hierarchical structure of bone. First, we
   briefly summarize the hierarchical structure of bone, spanning from the
   nanoscale, sub-microscale, microscale, mesoscale to the macroscale, and
   discuss experimental observations on failure mechanisms in bone at these
   scales. Then, we highlight representative analytical and computational
   models of bone fracture and strength at different length scales and
   discuss the main findings in the context of experiments. We conclude by
   summarizing the challenges in modelling of bone fracture and strength
   and list open topics for scientific exploration. Modelling of bone,
   accounting for different scales, provides new and needed insights into
   the fracture and strength of bone, which, in turn, can lead to improved
   diagnostic tools and treatments of bone diseases such as osteoporosis.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the quasi static transverse compression behavior
   of Kevlar KM2 single fiber widely used in high velocity impact (HVI)
   applications. The nominal stress strain response of single fibers
   exhibits nonlinear inelastic behavior under transverse compression. The
   nonlinearity is due to both geometric and material nonlinearities. The
   inelastic behavior is attributed to plastic deformation and
   microstructural damage resulting from fibrillation and micro cracking.
   The experimental set up allows for the observation and measurement of
   compressed width in real time. An experimental methodology is presented
   to determine the fiber material constitutive behavior by removing the
   geometric nonlinearity due to the growing contact area. Results from
   finite element model of the test method are correlated with the
   experimental results to assess the accuracy of the constitutive model.

Title = {{From diffuse damage to sharp cohesive cracks: A coupled XFEM framework
   for failure analysis of quasi-brittle materials}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{299}},
Pages = {{57-89}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Failure of quasi-brittle materials is governed by crack formation and
   propagation which can be characterized by two phases: (i) diffuse
   material degradation process with initial crack formation and (ii)
   severe localization of damage leading to the propagation of large cracks
   and fracture. While continuum damage mechanics provides an excellent
   framework to describe the first failure phase, it is unable to represent
   discontinuous displacement fields. In sharp contrast, cohesive zone
   models are poorly suited for describing diffuse damage but can
   accurately resolve discrete cracks.
   In this manuscript, we propose a coupled continuous/discontinuous
   approach to model the two failure phases of quasi-brittle materials in a
   coherent way. The proposed approach involves an integral-type nonlocal
   continuum damage model coupled with an extrinsic discrete interface
   model. The transition from diffuse damage to macroscopic cohesive cracks
   is made through an equivalent thermodynamic framework established in
   multidimensional settings, in which the dissipated energy is computed
   numerically and weakly matched. The method is implemented within the
   extended finite element framework, which allows for crack propagation
   without remeshing. A few benchmark problems involving straight and
   curved cracks are investigated to demonstrate the applicability and
   robustness of the coupled XFEM cohesive-damage approach.
   Force-displacement responses, as well as predicted propagation paths,
   are presented and shown to be in close agreement with available
   experimental data. Furthermore, the method is found to be insensitive to
   various damage threshold values for damage-crack transition, yielding
   energetically consistent results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{670}},

Abstract = {{Anisotropic fatigue and cyclic behaviour of AM30 Mg alloy extrusion is
   investigated by performing fully-reversed strain-controlled
   tension-compression cyclic tests at strain amplitudes between 0.3\% and
   2.3\%, along extrusion (ED) and transverse (TD) directions. The shapes
   of half-life hysteresis loops suggest the predominance of slip and
   twinning/de-twinning mechanisms below and above the strain amplitude of
   0.5\%, respectively. The twinning/de-twinning occurrence is found to be
   more extensive during straining along ED, which results in higher
   asymmetry of hysteresis loops, and thereby, higher induced mean stress.
   This adversely affects the fatigue resistance and yields to less number
   of cycles before failure in ED. Optical microscopy and texture analysis
   are employed to validate the findings. In addition, fracture surfaces
   are studied by scanning electron microscopy to identify the sources of
   fatigue crack initiation. Persistent slip bands (PSBs) and twin lamellae
   interfaces are evidenced as crack initiation sites at low and high
   strain amplitudes, respectively. Cracks emanated from debonded inclusion
   interface are also observed. Lastly, estimated fatigue life by
   Smith-Watson-Topper (SWT) and Jahed-Varvani (JV) fatigue models are
   compared with experimental life obtained through this study as well as
   the ones reported in the literature. The JV energy model is proven to
   yield better life predictions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, the core shale samples from the Lower Longmaxi Formation
   (LF) in the southwest of the Sichuan Basin of China are carried out
   laboratory experiments to investigate the wettability and adsorption
   characteristics. The influences of the wettability on the development of
   the shale gas reservoirs were discussed. And the influences of the
   kerogen and the pure mineral on the methane adsorption capacity were
   discussed. The differences between the methane adsorption capacity of
   the pure mineral and the mixed minerals were also discussed. The results
   show that the spontaneous imbibition rate of the LF shale samples tended
   to rise firstly and then become stable with the increasing of the time;
   The spontaneous imbibition rate of water was higher than the spontaneous
   imbibition rate of oil; The methane adsorption capacity on the kerogen
   and the pure minerals first increased rapidly and then increased slowly
   and tended to be stable with the increasing of the pressure; The methane
   adsorption capacity on the kerogen was much larger than the different
   pure minerals; And among the different pure minerals, the order of the
   methane adsorption capacity is that: illite > chlorite > quartz; The
   water molecules would reduce the methane adsorption capacity on the
   Kerogen; The methane adsorption capacity of the Mixed minerals can be
   approximately equal to the sum of the methane adsorption capacity of the
   pure minerals calculated by the mass ratios. The water blocking damage
   in the shale formation can't be assessed according to the water blocking
   damage evaluation system of the conventional oil and gas reservoirs. The
   mixed wettability, the influence of the water on the methane adsorption
   capacity and water-induced cracks should be considered in the water
   blocking damage evaluation system of the shale reservoir. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Ultra high performance fibre reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) is a
   cement-based composite material mixing with reactive powder and steel
   fibres. It is characterized by its high strength, high ductility and
   high toughness and such characteristics enable its great potential in
   protective engineering against extreme loads such as impact or
   explosion. In the present study, a series of field tests were conducted
   to investigate the behaviour of UHPFRC columns subjected to blast
   loading. In total four 0.2 m x 0.2 m x 2.5 m UHPFRC columns were tested
   under different designed explosions but all at a standoff distance of
   1.5 m. Blast tests were also performed on four high strength reinforced
   concrete (HSRC) columns with the same size and reinforcement as UHPFRC
   columns to evaluate their behaviour under the same loading conditions.
   The data collected from each specimen included reflected overpressures,
   column deflections at centre and near the supports. Three major damage
   modes, including flexural, shear and concrete spalling failure modes,
   were observed. The post blast crack patterns, permanent deflections and
   different levels of damage observations showed that UHPFRC columns
   performed superior in blast loading resistance as compared with HSRC
   columns. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The study of near-threshold fatigue crack growth has long remained an
   empirical field due principally to the highly microstructure-sensitive
   nature thereof. The primary challenges have been to forward physical
   model(s) informed by the governing micromechanism(s), which would be
   able to predict the experimental behaviors devoid of empiricism. Today,
   we have sophisticated experimental techniques (e.g. digital image
   correlation, electron microscopy) as well as atomistic simulation tools
   (e.g. molecular dynamics) at our disposal to finally revisit the century
   old fatigue problem in the light of physical phenomena therein. This
   paper is geared towards achieving such a feat with a very special type
   of materials, nano-twinned alloys, as the candidate materials, which are
   of great recent interest due to their reportedly superior damage
   properties. Specifically, we investigate how the microstructural
   features (e.g. slip transfer mechanism at coherent twin boundaries, twin
   thickness/spacing, frictional stress, pre-existent near-tip slip
   density) can be modulated to improve the damage resistance. The results
   suggest that these parameters considerably affect the crack propagation
   impedance (as quantified in terms of Delta K-eff(th)). A thorough
   discussion of the current findings and the most recent literature
   developments in this regard are provided. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Ductile failure of structural metals is relevant to a wide range of
   engineering scenarios. Computational methods are employed to anticipate
   the critical conditions of failure, yet they sometimes provide
   inaccurate and misleading predictions. Challenge scenarios, such as the
   one presented in the current work, provide an opportunity to assess the
   blind, quantitative predictive ability of simulation methods against a
   previously unseen failure problem. Rather than evaluate the predictions
   of a single simulation approach, the Sandia Fracture Challenge relies on
   numerous volunteer teams with expertise in computational mechanics to
   apply a broad range of computational methods, numerical algorithms, and
   constitutive models to the challenge. This exercise is intended to
   evaluate the state of health of technologies available for failure
   prediction. In the first Sandia Fracture Challenge, a wide range of
   issues were raised in ductile failure modeling, including a lack of
   consistency in failure models, the importance of shear calibration data,
   and difficulties in quantifying the uncertainty of prediction {[}see
   Boyce et al. (Int J Fract 186:5-68, 2014) for details of these
   observations]. This second Sandia Fracture Challenge investigated the
   ductile rupture of a Ti-6Al-4V sheet under both quasi-static and
   modest-rate dynamic loading (failure in 0.1 s). Like the previous
   challenge, the sheet had an unusual arrangement of notches and holes
   that added geometric complexity and fostered a competition between
   tensile- and shear-dominated failure modes. The teams were asked to
   predict the fracture path and quantitative far-field failure metrics
   such as the peak force and displacement to cause crack initiation.
   Fourteen teams contributed blind predictions, and the experimental
   outcomes were quantified in three independent test labs. Additional
   shortcomings were revealed in this second challenge such as
   inconsistency in the application of appropriate boundary conditions,
   need for a thermomechanical treatment of the heat generation in the
   dynamic loading condition, and further difficulties in model calibration
   based on limited real-world engineering data. As with the prior
   challenge, this work not only documents the `state-of-the-art' in
   computational failure prediction of ductile tearing scenarios, but also
   provides a detailed dataset for non-blind assessment of alternative
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{This work aims to investigate compressive strength changes,
   Vickers-hardness of exposed surface, microstructure evolution and pore
   structure of geopolymer prepared using fly ash as resource material and
   activated by sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide solutions after
   exposed to sulfate attack for 28, 90 and 180 days when fly ash was
   partially replaced by metakaolin at levels ranging from 0\% to 20\% with
   an interval of 5\%, by weight.
   The experimental results uncover that geopolymer suffers strength loss
   after sulfate attack exposure but gains strength with increasing
   replacement level of fly ash by metakaolin from 5\% to 20\% and obvious
   increasing in compressive strength could be observed when the
   replacement percentage exceeds 15\%. The sulfate attack exposure shifts
   the peak value of pore size to a higher value and leads to the
   development of a macropore system with high porosity and deduction of
   surface Vickers-hardness. A denser microstructure with higher surface
   Vickers-hardness of metakaolin containing geopolymer can be obtained
   compared to geopolymer without metakaolin. A good linear relationship
   has been found between compressive strength loss and Vickers-hardness
   values of exposed surface. Compressive strength loss in geopolymer after
   sulfate attack exposure relates to the microcrack development and high
   porosity. Longer exposure leads to higher deduction in compressive
   strength and acceleration in deterioration degree which lead to
   expansion stress and cracks. Partial replacement of fly ash by
   metakaolin improves the mechanical properties, optimizes the
   microstructure and reduces the level of damage from sulfate attack. (C)

   composites, Ti-Al3Ti-Al2O3-Al, were synthesized by reactive foil
   sintering in air. Microstructure controlled material architectures were
   achieved with continuous Al2O3 fibers oriented in 0 and 90 layers to
   form fully dense composites in which the volume fractions of all four
   component phases can be tailored. Bend fracture specimens were cut from
   the laminate plates in divider orientation, and bend tests were
   performed to study the fracture behavior of CFR-MIL composites under
   three-point and four-point bending loading conditions. The
   microstructures and fractured surfaces of the CFR-MIL composites were
   examined using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy to
   establish a correlation between the fracture toughness, fracture surface
   morphology and microstructures of CFR-MIL composites. The fracture and
   toughening mechanisms of the CFR-MIL composites are also addressed. The
   present experimental results indicate that the fracture toughness of
   CFR-MIL composites determined by three- and four-point bend loading
   configurations are quite similar, and increased significantly compared
   to MIL composites without ceramic fiber reinforcement. The interface
   cracking behavior is related to the volume fraction of the brittle Al3Ti
   phase and residual ductile Al, but the fracture toughness values appear
   to be insensitive to the ratio of these two phases. The toughness
   appears to be dominated by the ductility/strength of the Ti layers and
   the strength and crack bridging effect of the ceramic fibers. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In this work 3D strain and damage analyses are performed in the
   immediate vicinity of the notch root of a flat CT-like specimen made of
   aluminum alloy. Experimental data, partially exploited by Morgeneyer et
   al. (Acta Mat 69:78-91, 2014b), were obtained by using synchrotron
   laminography and the 3D reconstructed volumes are subsequently analyzed
   via Digital volume correlation. These data enable for in situ
   assessments of strain fields and ductile damage in the zone where the
   stress triaxiality evolves from elevated to lower levels, which is
   accompanied by flat-to-slant crack transition. The measured strain field
   patterns in this area are analyzed herein in a systematic manner by
   studying the incremental strain activity during several loading steps.
   It is shown that from the very beginning of the loading history multiple
   slant strained bands appear in front of the notch root while the
   corresponding damage growth sets in at later loading stages and higher
   strains. The activity of the different strained bands at the notch root
   is alternating between different locations over the loading history.
   However, the band leading to final rupture is always active. The region
   where slant fracture occurs is identified to be in plane strain
   condition with respect to the crack propagation direction.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an in-situ tensile test in synchrotron tomography
   achieved for the first time with a frequency of 20 tomograms per second
   (20 Hz acquisition frequency). This allows us to capture rapid material
   fracture processes, such as that of a metal matrix composite composed of
   45 \% of alumina particles embedded into 55 \% of pure aluminium, which
   fractures by the sudden coalescence of internal damage. Qualitatively,
   the images show the nucleation and propagation of a crack during 9 s
   leading to total fracture of the sample. The images are then
   post-processed quantitatively to analyze the evolving shape of the crack
   and to derive the instantaneous speed of its tip. It is shown that the
   crack clearly propagates from one particle to the next, pausing briefly
   before propagating to the next particle, lending experimental support to
   a local load sharing analysis of the fracture of this class of
   composite.}},

Abstract = {{Subsurface damage (SSD) induced during abrasive grain machining process
   strongly influences the mechanical strength and subsurface quality of
   the brittle components. Therefore, it is meaningful to study the
   relationship between SSD and grinding parameters. The methods of
   theoretical analysis, numerical simulation and experimental testing are
   used to analyze the SSD of brittle materials in high-speed grinding. The
   results of numerical simulation are consistent with those of theoretical
   analysis and experimental testing, which indicates that the present
   numerical method is reasonable. The investigation focuses on the effects
   of wheel speed, grinding depth, and apex angle of the abrasive grain on
   the SSD of brittle materials. It shows that when maximum undeformed chip
   thickness (M-UCT) is greater than the critical thickness of brittle
   fracture, the material removal is mainly in the brittle mode. A high
   wheel speed is beneficial to achieving a good subsurface quality.
   However, under certain conditions, an ultra-high wheel speed with quite
   small grinding depth is not helpful in SSD control. Due to the kinematic
   characteristics of the grinding process, the effect of grinding depth on
   SSD is weaker than that of wheel speed and a smaller abrasive grain is
   of advantage to subsurface quality. In addition, the grinding force is
   one of the major factors influencing the subsurface quality.}},

Title = {{Experimental damage evaluation of reinforced concrete steel bars using
   piezoelectric sensors}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{105}},

Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{This study presents an experimental effort for the damage assessment of
   concrete reinforcing bars using bonded piezoelectric transducers and the
   implementation of an integration analytical approach based on the
   electromechanical admittance method. Tests are performed in (i) single
   steel reinforcing bars with predefined and artificially induced damages
   corresponding to two different damage states and (ii) steel reinforcing
   bars embedded in typical large scale reinforced concrete beams subjected
   to flexural load at two different loading levels (before and after
   yielding) that inevitably cause two different damage levels. The damage
   of the embedded steel bars in the concrete beams after yielding is the
   result of excessive elongation of the bars due to yielding caused by
   flexural deformation of the beams. Test measurements of healthy and
   damaged steel bars and reinforced concrete beams have been conducted
   using the developed monitoring system. The experimental program
   comprises data acquisition of current intensity curves for healthy and
   damaged bars as detected by the test instrumentation and implementation
   of the adopted admittance-based procedure to evaluate damages at
   different levels. It can be concluded that the sensitivity of the
   piezoelectric transducers greatly depends on the selection of the
   excitation frequencies. Admittance signatures showed a clear gradation
   of the examined damage levels. The experimental results provide cogent
   evidence that piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate transducers are
   sensitive to damage detection in concrete and in steel reinforcing bars
   from an early stage of the performed tests. Thus, the use of these
   sensors for monitoring and detecting concrete cracking and steel
   yielding by employing the electromechanical admittance approach can be
   considered as a highly promising non-destructive structural health
   monitoring method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a phase-field model for ductile fracture previously

   qualitatively and quantitatively compared with several experimental
   results, both from ad-hoc tests carried out by the authors and from the

   assumption that fracture occurs when a scalar measure of the accumulated
   plastic strain reaches a critical value, and such assumption is
   introduced through the dependency of the phase-field degradation
   function on this scalar measure. The proposed model is able to capture
   the experimentally observed sequence of elasto-plastic deformation,
   necking and fracture phenomena in flat specimens; the occurrence of
   cup-and-cone fracture patterns in axisymmetric specimens; the role
   played by notches and by their size on the measured displacement at

Abstract = {{In this work, the chloride penetration into concrete damaged by uniaxial
   tensile fatigue loading was characterized. Various fatigue-damaged
   concrete were exposed to two environmental conditions (i.e. immersion
   and drying-wetting cycles) for different durations. A quantitative
   correlation has been established to predict the effects of residual
   strains on the apparent chloride diffusivity of fatigue-damaged
   concrete. The experimental results show that the tensile fatigue damage
   can accelerate the chloride penetration in concrete by 1.5-3.0 times,
   when the magnitude of maximum tensile fatigue load is between 25\% and
   45\% of the ultimate tensile load of the specimen. When the maximum
   fatigue load is greater than 30\% of the ultimate tensile loads, the
   chloride penetration is substantially accelerated. In summary, the
   chloride ingress into concrete is dependent on the exposure condition,
   duration, type of binder, and degree of fatigue damage. (C) 2016

Journal = {{MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING}},

Abstract = {{Detection of multiple damage using modal curvature in noisy environments
   has become a research focus of considerable challenge and great
   significance over the last few years. However, a noticeable deficiency
   of modal curvature is its susceptibility to noise, which usually results
   in a noisy modal curvature with obscured damage signature. To address
   this deficiency, this study formulates a new concept of complex-wavelet
   modal curvature. Complex-wavelet modal curvature features the ability to
   reveal and delineate damage under noisy conditions. The effectiveness of
   the concept is analytically verified using cracked beams with various
   types of boundary conditions. The applicability is further
   experimentally validated by an aluminum beam with a single crack and a
   carbon-fiber reinforced polymer composite beam with three cracks in the
   laboratory with mode shapes measured by a scanning laser vibrometer.
   Both analytical and experimental results have demonstrated that the
   complex-wavelet modal curvature is capable of revealing slight damage by
   eliminating noise interference, with no need for prior knowledge of
   either material properties or boundary conditions of the beam under
   inspection. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we studied the self-healing of composite materials filled with
   epoxy-containing nanofibers. An initial incision in the middle of a
   composite sample stretched in a static fatigue test can result in either
   crack propagation or healing. In this study, crack evolution was
   observed in real time. A binary epoxy, which acted as a self-healing
   agent, was encapsulated in two separate types of interwoven
   nano/microfibers formed by dual-solution blowing, with the core
   containing either epoxy or hardener and the shell being formed from
   poly(vinylidene fluoride)/ poly(ethylene oxide) mixture. The core shell
   fibers were encased in a poly(dimethylsiloxane) matrix. When the fibers
   were damaged by a growing crack in this fiber-reinforced composite
   material because of static stretching in the fatigue test, they broke
   and released the healing agent into the crack area. The epoxy used in
   this study was cured and solidified for approximately an hour at room
   temperature, which then conglutinated and healed the damaged location.
   The observations were made for at least several hours and in some cases
   up to several days. It was revealed that the presence of the healing
   agent (the epoxy) in the fibers successfully prevented the propagation
   of cracks in stretched samples subjected to the fatigue test. A
   theoretical analysis of subcritical cracks was performed, and it
   revealed a jumplike growth of subcritical cracks, which was in
   qualitative agreement with the experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, significant attention has been devoted to the utilization of
   new sensing technologies for pavement maintenance and preservation
   systems. This study presents a new approach for the continuous health
   monitoring of asphalt concrete pavements based on piezoelectric
   self-powered sensing technology. The beauty of this technology is that
   the signal sensed by the piezoelectric transducers from traffic loading
   can be used both for empowering the self-powered sensors and damage
   diagnosis. Numerical and experimental studies were carried out to
   evaluate the damage detection performance of the proposed self-sustained
   sensing system. A three-dimensional finite element analysis was
   performed to obtain the pavement responses under moving tire loading.
   Damage was introduced as bottom-up fatigue cracks at the bottom of the
   asphalt layer. Thereafter, features extracted from the dynamic strain
   data for a number of sensing nodes were used to detect the damage
   progression. The laboratory tests were carried out on an asphalt
   concrete specimen in three point bending mode. For the protection of the
   embedded sensors, a new miniaturized spherical packaging system was
   designed and tested. Based on the results of the numerical study, the
   sensing nodes located along the loading path are capable of detecting
   the damage progression. Besides, the experimental study indicates that
   the proposed method is efficient in detecting different damage states
   including crack propagation. Finally, the possibility of localizing the
   damage and quantifying its severity was investigated and discussed. (C)

Abstract = {{A detailed understanding of damage evolution in rock after
   high-temperature treatment in unloading conditions is extremely
   important in underground engineering applications, such as the disposal
   of highly radioactive nuclear waste, underground coal gasification, and
   post-disaster reconstruction. We have studied the effects of temperature
   (200, 400, 600 and 800 A degrees C) and confining pressure (20, 30 and
   40 MPa) on the mechanical properties of sandstone. Scanning electron
   microscopy studies revealed that at temperatures exceeding 400 A degrees
   C, new cracks formed, and original cracks extended substantially. When
   the confining pressure was 20 MPa, a temperature increase from 400 to
   800 A degrees C resulted in a 75.2\% increase in peak strain, a decrease
   in Young's modulus and peak strength of 62.5 and 35.8 \%, respectively,
   and transition of the failure mechanism from brittleness to ductility.
   In the triaxial compression tests, the specimen deformed in a more
   obvious ductile failure manner at higher confining pressure, whereas in
   the unloading confining pressure experiments, brittle failure was more
   obvious when the initial confining pressure was higher. We focused on
   the effects of temperature and initial confining pressure on peak
   effective loading stress and peak ductile deformation during unloading.
   At temperatures of > 400 A degrees C, the peak ductile deformation
   increased rapidly with increases in the high temperature treatment or
   initial confining pressure. The peak effective loading stress decreased
   sharply with increased temperature but barely changed when the initial
   confining pressure was varied.}},

Title = {{Damage and plastic friction in initially anisotropic quasi brittle
   materials}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{82}},
Pages = {{260-282}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{A three dimensional micro-mechanical model is developed for modeling
   micro-crack growth and plastic frictional sliding in initially
   anisotropic quasi brittle materials under compressive loading.
   Macroscopic strains are attributed to elastic deformation of matrix and
   displacement discontinuity on micro-cracks. Effective elastic properties
   of cracked materials are determined using a Eshelby's solution based
   linear homogenization technique by considering micro-cracks as
   spheroidal inclusions. An efficient numerical method is used to
   calculate Hill polarization tensor for spheroidal micro-cracks
   arbitrarily embedded in transversely isotropic solid matrix. Based on
   this, the plastic strain related to frictional sliding on closed
   micro-cracks is determined by combining irreversible thermodynamics and
   homogenization method. A specific plastic friction criterion is
   formulated in terms of the local stress field on crack surfaces. The
   presence of a back stress tensor allows description of material
   hardening and softening without any additional functions. A specific
   damage evolution law is finally proposed. The evolutions of the
   friction-related plastic strain and crack-propagation induced damage are
   inherently coupled. A series of numerical assessments are presented for
   various loading paths such as uniaxial compression, triaxial compression
   and shear. The obtained numerical results clearly reveal that the
   macroscopic behaviors of cracked materials are strongly affected by the
   initial anisotropy. Finally, the performance of the proposed
   micro-mechanical model is verified by comparing numerical results and
   experimental data for a typical rock-like materials, shale. (C) 2016

Journal = {{MEASUREMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{20-31}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{For a planetary gear set, the transducer-perceived vibration signal
   contains vibration information from multiple sources including the sun
   gear, planet gears, and the ring gear. All these vibration sources are
   subject to corresponding transmission path effects. In this paper, a
   comprehensive vibration signal model for a planetary gear set is
   proposed considering all the vibration sources and transmission path
   effects. Vibration sources were generated with a nonlinear
   two-dimensional lumped-parameter dynamic model. Transmission path
   effects are modeled as two parts: the part inside the gearbox to the
   casing and the other part along the casing to the transducer position.
   Given the gear sizes, the transmission path effect modeling parameters
   are estimated. Then the influences of different transmission paths on
   resultant vibration signals are analyzed. Some vibration characteristics
   are revealed for one healthy planetary gear set. These vibration
   characteristics are validated with lab experimental data in both time
   domain and frequency domain. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{This study presents the results of a large experimental campaign
   conducted on, the Luli2000 laser facility. Thin targets of a commercial
   grade of porous graphite were submitted to high-power laser-driven
   shocks leading to their fragmentation. Many diagnostics were used such
   as high-speed time- and space resolved imaging systems (shadowgraphy and
   photography), laser velocimetry (PDV and VISAR), debris collection and
   post-mortem X-ray tomography. They provided the loading levels into the
   targets, the spall strength of the material, the shape and size of
   debris and the localization of the subsurface cracks. The crossed data
   reduction of all the records showed their reliability and allowed to get
   a better insight into the damage phenomena at play in graphite. Thereby,
   four damage regimes, ranked according to their severity and loading
   level, were identified. It confirms that laser shocks are very
   complementary to classical impact tests (plates and spheres) since they
   ally two-dimensional loadings to the possibility of using both, in-situ
   and post-mortem diagnostics. Finally, the campaign shall be able to
   provide large and consistent data to develop and adjust reliable models
   for shock wave propagation and damage into porous graphite. (C) 2016

Title = {{Ultraviolet Laser-induced ignition of RDX single crystal}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 5}},
Abstract = {{The RDX single crystals are ignited by ultraviolet laser (355 nm, 6.4
   ns) pulses. The laser-induced damage morphology consisted of two
   distinct regions: a core region of layered fracture and a peripheral
   region of stripped material surrounding the core. As laser fluence
   increases, the area of the whole crack region increases all the way,
   while both the area and depth of the core region increase firstly, and
   then stay stable over the laser fluence of 12 J/cm(2). The experimental
   details indicate the dynamics during laser ignition process. Plasma
   fireball of high temperature and pressure occurs firstly, followed by
   the micro-explosions on the (210) surface, and finally shock waves
   propagate through the materials to further strip materials outside and
   yield in-depth cracks in larger surrounding region. The plasma fireball
   evolves from isotropic to anisotropic under higher laser fluence
   resulting in the damage expansion only in lateral direction while
   maintaining the fixed depth. The primary insights into the interaction
   dynamics between laser and energetic materials can help developing the
   superior laser ignition technique.}},

   a 3D Point Cloud for Landslide Scarp Recognition}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Landslides often cause economic losses, property damage, and loss of
   lives. Monitoring landslides using high spatial and temporal resolution
   imagery and the ability to quickly identify landslide regions are the
   basis for emergency disaster management. This study presents a
   comprehensive system that uses unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and
   Semi-Global dense Matching (SGM) techniques to identify and extract
   landslide scarp data. The selected study area is located along a major
   highway in a mountainous region in Jordan, and contains creeping
   landslides induced by heavy rainfall. Field observations across the
   slope body and a deformation analysis along the highway and existing
   gabions indicate that the slope is active and that scarp features across
   the slope will continue to open and develop new tension crack features,
   leading to the downward movement of rocks. The identification of
   landslide scarps in this study was performed via a dense 3D point cloud
   of topographic information generated from high-resolution images
   captured using a low-cost UAV and a target-based camera calibration
   procedure for a low-cost large-field-of-view camera. An automated
   approach was used to accurately detect and extract the landslide head
   scarps based on geomorphological factors: the ratio of normalized
   Eigenvalues (i.e., 1/2 3) derived using principal component analysis,
   topographic surface roughness index values, and local-neighborhood slope
   measurements from the 3D image-based point cloud. Validation of the
   results was performed using root mean square error analysis and a
   confusion (error) matrix between manually digitized landslide scarps and
   the automated approaches. The experimental results using the fully
   automated 3D point-based analysis algorithms show that these approaches
   can effectively distinguish landslide scarps. The proposed algorithms
   can accurately identify and extract landslide scarps with
   centimeter-scale accuracy. In addition, the combination of UAV-based
   imagery, 3D scene reconstruction, and landslide scarp
   recognition/extraction algorithms can provide flexible and effective
   tool for monitoring landslide scarps and is acceptable for landslide
   mapping purposes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the possibility of using classical first order
   computational homogenization together with a simple regularization
   procedure based on the fracture energy of the micro-scale-constituents.
   A generalized geometrical characteristic length takes into account the
   size of the macro-scale element as well as the size of the RVE (and its
   constituents). The proposed regularization ensures objectivity of the
   dissipated energy at the macro-scale, with respect to the size of the FE
   in both scales and with respect to the size of the RVE. The proposed
   method is first validated against benchmark examples, and finally
   applied to the numerical simulation of experimental tests on in-plane
   loaded shear walls made of periodic masonry.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical study, accompanied by the experimental data from Part 1 of
   this paper, provides a clear picture of the global damage behaviour and
   local response of four scaled Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP)
   laminates under quasi-static transverse loading. Interface elements with
   a cohesive formulation are employed to model delamination, matrix cracks
   and their interaction. The predictive damage from different numerical
   simulations with different levels of detail is presented, and the
   validity is illustrated both qualitatively and quantitatively.
   Specifically the number of inserted potential intralaminar crack paths
   is varied from no cracks, through single, then double, to multiple
   cracks. It is shown that the models with the capability to simulate
   multiple matrix cracks best predict the key aspects of barely visible
   damage of composite laminate during quasi-static loading. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A finite element based numerical model is developed to simulate the
   thermal cracking behavior of brittle solids subjected to thermal shock.
   The heterogeneity of the brittle solids at mesoscopic level is taken
   into account using the Weibull distribution. Furthermore, the cracking
   behavior of meso-element is modeled using continuum damage mechanics.
   The finite element method (FEM) is used to obtain thermal stress
   distribution, and then damage threshold is determined by the maximum
   tensile stress criterion. In the present work, the cracking behavior,
   including the initiation and propagation of microcracks, and the
   formation of approximately equally spaced surface cracks, are well
   captured by the numerical model. Furthermore, the impact of thermal
   conductivity on the cracking pattern of the heterogeneous brittle solids
   is also discussed in this study. The numerical simulation results are
   found to be consistent with the experimental observations in the
   literature, which indicates that the proposed numerical model is a
   potentially powerful tool to study the cracking behavior of the
   heterogeneous brittle solids subjected to thermal shock. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Fracture mechanics at micro- and nano-scale has become a very attractive
   topic in the last years. However, the results are still few, mostly
   because of the lack of effective analytical tools and of the difficult
   to conduct experimental tests at those scales. In this study, the
   authors report preliminary analysis on the application of the Strain
   Energy Density (SED) method at nano-scale. In detail, starting from
   mechanical properties experimentally evaluated on small single crystal
   silicon cracked specimens, a first evaluation of the control volume due
   to a nano-size singular stress field is carried out. If the extension of
   the SED approach at micro- nano-scale is given in near future, an easy
   and fast tool to design against fatigue will be provided for micro-
   nano-devices such as MEMS and NEMS, resulting in a significant
   technological impact and providing an easy and fast tool to conduct
   static and fatigue assessment at micro- and nano-scale.}},

Title = {{Scale-wavenumber domain filtering method for curvature modal damage
   detection}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{154}},
Pages = {{396-409}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{In damage assessment of composite structures, the modal curvature
   appears to be one of the most important damage indices in the past
   decades. However, a noticeable deficiency of the modal curvature is its
   susceptibility to noise, which is mainly induced by the numerical
   difference estimation. This study proposes the scale-wavenumber domain
   filtering method based on the combination of the continuous wavelets
   transform, the discrete Fourier transform-based modal curvature and the
   scale wavenumber domain filtering method. The continuous wavelet
   transform provides the scale domain for noisy mode shape analysis, in
   which the normal fluctuations and the noise-induced fluctuations are
   filtered from the inspected mode shapes. The discrete Fourier
   transform-based modal curvature supplies the wavenumber domain
   expressions of the scaled mode shapes. In the scale and wavenumber
   domains, some special filters are designed and used in noise
   suppression. The effectiveness of the proposed method is analytically
   verified by employing the cracked composite beam model, and the
   performance is further validated by the experimental data from the
   carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer beam with crack. Based on these
   validations, it is observed that the proposed method is capable of
   revealing slight damage in noisy condition, without the requirement for
   the prior knowledge of material properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

   Experimental and numerical investigation}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{152}},
Pages = {{339-348}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of the present study was to determine the nature and area of
   damage in fibre metal laminates subjected to low-velocity impact using a
   numerical model based on defined damage criteria in relation to executed
   experimental tests. The plates 1.5-3.5 mm thick made of
   aluminium/epoxy-glass composite produced in autoclave process were
   subjected to tests. The low-velocity impact test was performed at room
   temperature using a drop-weight impact tester with impact energy 10 J
   and 25 J. On the basis of obtained results, the results of experimental
   tests and numerical analyses have been found compatible in the scope of
   specific relationships i.e. force vs. time, internal damage areas and
   laminates damage mechanism prevailing in their structure. The principal
   laminates damage forms encompassed delaminations occurring in composite
   interlayers and on metal-composite interface, cracks in composite layers
   and in lower layers of metal. Presented modelling of impact in fibre
   metal laminates using VUMAT code enables the evaluation of their
   structure damage and the selection of proper laminate configuration in
   future in terms of their resistance to low-velocity impact. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{A prior study conducted by the authors had investigated the behaviour of
   thin composite double lap joint repairs. This investigation was an
   extension to the previous study and focused on analysing the behaviour
   of thick step lap joint repairs which are more complicated in nature.
   Finite element analysis (FEA) was performed to verify the static and
   fatigue strength of bolted, bonded and hybrid joint configurations.
   Thick carbon fibre/epoxy laminates and aerospace grade film adhesive and
   fasteners were selected. Several configurations were considered in this
   case. These include varying the number of fasteners in the joint region
   as well as inclusion of bondline defects. Adhesive non-linear material
   properties, fastener contacts and frictional forces were all included in
   the three dimensional (3D) finite element (FE) models. The progressive
   failure process was simulated and the Multicontinuum Theory (MCT) was
   used to determine the stress states in all specimens considered. The
   strain energy release rate (SERR) as a function of crack length was also
   utilised to gain further understanding into the fatigue behaviour.
   Overall the FE models are able to accurately predict the bonded, bolted
   and hybrid joint strengths. SERR results suggest it is vital to place
   fasteners closer to the ends of the overlap to suppress the peak peeling
   stresses and to delay the effects of early crack initiation. This
   overall improves the longevity of a conventional bonded joint design.
