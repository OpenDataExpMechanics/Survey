Abstract = {{Ductile fracture is often considered as the consequences of the
   accumulation of plastic damage. This paper is concerned with the
   application of a recently developed damage plasticity theory
   incorporates the pressure sensitivity and the Lode angle dependence into
   a nonlinear damage rule and the material deterioration. The ductile
   damaging process is calculated through the so-called ``cylindrical
   decomposition{''} method. The constitutive equations are discussed and
   numerically implemented. An experimental and numerical investigation for
   three-point bending tests is reported for aluminum alloy 2024-T351.
   Crack initiation and propagation in compact tension specimens are also
   studied numerically. These simulation results show good agreement with
   experiments. The present model can successfully predict slant fracture
   as well as the formation of shear lips. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All

   dispersive spectroscopy. The corrosion pattern was mainly characterized
   by a rust layer confined at the interface between the steel and the

   rust thickness and the Faraday's law. Furthermore, in order to
   understand the mechanical effects of corrosion on the damage of mortar,
   displacement field measurements were obtained by using digital image
   correlation. An analytical model (hollow cylinder subjected to inner and

Abstract = {{The dynamic behavior of composite laminates is very complex because
   there are many concurrent phenomena during composite laminate failure
   under impact load. Fiber breakage, delaminations, matrix cracking,
   plastic deformations due to contact and large displacements are some
   effects which should be considered when a structure made from composite
   material is impacted by a foreign object. Thus, an investigation of the
   low velocity impact on laminated composite thin disks of epoxy resin
   reinforced by carbon fiber is presented. The influence of stacking
   sequence and energy impact was investigated using load-time histories,
   displacement-time histories and energy-time histories as well as images
   from NDE. Indentation tests results were compared to dynamic results,
   verifying the inertia effects when thin composite laminate was impacted
   by foreign object with low velocity. Finite element analysis (FEA) was
   developed, using Hill's model and material models implemented by UMAT
   (User Material Subroutine) into software ABAQUS (TM), in order to

Abstract = {{Extensive fatigue experiments were conducted using 7075-T651 aluminum
   alloy under uniaxial, torsion, and axial-torsion loading. Detailed
   fatigue results were reported. Different mean stresses were applied in
   the experiments and the mean stress was found to have a significant
   influence on the fatigue strength of the material. A tensile mean stress
   decreased the fatigue strength dramatically. Fatigue damage was found to
   occur under compression-compression loading. In addition, axial-torsion
   experiments using tubular specimens were conducted under different
   loading paths to study the multiaxial fatigue behavior. Fatigue cracking
   behavior was found to be dependent on the loading path as well as the
   loading magnitude. When the loading magnitude was high, the material
   displayed shear cracking. When the loading stress was below a certain
   level, the material exhibited tensile cracking. For most loading cases
   under investigation, the material displayed a mixed cracking behavior. A
   kink was found in the shear strain versus fatigue life curve from the
   pure torsion experiments, and it was associated with a distinctive
   transition of cracking behavior. The Smith-Watson-Topper (SWT) parameter
   with a critical plane interpretation was found to correlate well with
   most of the experiments conducted in terms of fatigue lives. However,
   the SWT parameter cannot deal with the uniaxial fatigue conditions where
   the maximum stress is low or negative. More importantly, the model fails
   to correctly predict the cracking behavior observed experimentally on
   the material. A critical plane criterion based on a combination of the
   normal and shear components of the stresses and strains on material
   planes was found to better correlate the fatigue experiments in terms of
   both fatigue life and cracking behavior. The characteristics of the
   multiaxial fatigue criterion were discussed based on the experimental
   observations on 7075-T651 aluminum alloy. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper describes a combined fracture-plastic model for concrete.
   Tension is handled by a fracture model, based on the classical
   orthotropic smeared crack formulation and the crack band approach. It
   employs the Rankine failure criterion, exponential softening, and it can
   be used as a rotated or a fixed crack model. The plasticity model for
   concrete in compression is based on the Menetrey-Willam failure surface,
   the plastic volumetric strain as a hardening/softening parameter and a
   non-associated flow rule based on a nonlinear plastic potential
   function. Both models use a return-mapping algorithm for the integration
   of constitutive equations. Special attention is given to the development
   of an algorithm for the combination of the two models. The suggested
   combination algorithm is based on a recursive substitution, and it
   allows for the two models to be developed and formulated separately. The
   algorithm can handle cases when failure surfaces of both models are
   active, but also when physical changes such as crack closure occur. The
   model can be used to simulate concrete cracking, crushing under high
   confinement and crack closure due to crushing in other material
   directions. The model is integrated in a general finite element package
   ATENA and its performance is evaluated by comparisons with various
   experimental results from the literature. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Experimental measurements of permeability evolution during triaxial
   compression of initially intact crystalline rocks and implications for
   fluid flow in fault zones}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{113}},

Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{Detailed experimental studies of the development of permeability of
   crustal rock during deformation are essential in helping to understand
   fault mechanics and constrain larger-scale models that predict bulk
   fluid flow within the crust. Permeability is particularly enhanced in
   the damage zone of faults, where microfracture damage accumulates under
   stress less than that required for macroscopic failure. Experiments
   performed in the prefailure region can provide data directly applicable
   to these zones of microfracture damage surrounding faults. The strength,
   permeability, and pore fluid volume evolution of initially intact
   crystalline rocks (Cerro Cristales granodiorite and Westerly granite)
   under increasing differential load leading to macroscopic failure has
   been determined at water pore pressures of 50 MPa and varying effective
   pressures from 10 to 50 MPa. Permeability is seen to increase by up to,
   and over, 2 orders of magnitude prior to macroscopic failure, with the
   greatest increase seen at lowest effective pressures. Postfailure
   permeability is shown to be over 3 orders of magnitude higher than
   initial intact permeabilities and approaches the lower limit of
   predicted in situ bulk crustal permeabilities. Increasing amplitude
   cyclic loading tests show permeability-stress hysteresis, with high
   permeabilities maintained as differential stress is reduced and the
   greatest permeability increases are seen between 90 and 99\% of the
   failure stress. Prefailure permeabilities are nearly 7 to 9 orders of
   magnitude lower than that predicted by some high-pressure diffusive
   models suggesting that if these models are correct, microfracture matrix
   flow cannot dominate, and that bulk fluid flow must be dominated by
   larger-scale structures such as macrofractures. We present a model,
   based on our data, in which the permeability of a highly stressed fault
   tip process zone in low-permeability crystalline rocks increases by more
   than 2 orders of magnitude. Stress reduction related to the onward
   migration of the fault tip close damage zone cracks, while some
   permeability is maintained due to hysteresis from permanent
   microfracture damage.}},

   technique (VCCT) was used to determine the applied load that would cause
   free edge delamination. Experimental results showed that failure
   occurred at loads lower than those predicted. Matrix cracks, observed in
   the testing, were introduced into the model and interface elements were
   used to model the delamination development. This approach gave good
   correlation to the behaviour observed in the tests. Even in the
   specimens apparently dominated by fibre failure, delamination was shown

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A mechanism-based constitutive model is presented for the inelastic
   deformation and fracture of ceramics. The model comprises four essential
   features: (i) micro-crack extension rates based on stress-intensity
   calculations and a crack growth law, (ii) the effect of the crack
   density on the stiffness, inclusive of crack closure, (iii) plasticity
   at high confining pressures, and (iv) initial flaws that scale with the
   grain size. Predictions of stress/strain responses for a range of stress
   states demonstrate that the model captures the transition from
   deformation by micro-cracking at low triaxiality to plastic slip at high
   triaxialities. Moreover, natural outcomes of the model include dilation
   (or bulking) upon micro-cracking, as well as the increase in the shear
   strength of the damaged ceramic with increasing triaxiality. Cavity
   expansion calculations are used to extract some key physics relevant to
   penetration. Three domains have been identified: (i) quasi-static, where
   the ceramic fails due to the outward propagation of a compression damage
   front, (ii) intermediate velocity, where an outward propagating
   compression damage front is accompanied by an inward propagating tensile
   (or spallation) front caused by the reflection of the elastic wave from
   the outer surface and (iii) high velocity, wherein plastic deformation
   initiates at the inner surface of the shell followed by spalling within
   a tensile damage front when the elastic wave reflects from the outer
   surface. Consistent with experimental observations, the cavity pressure
   is sensitive to the grain size under quasi-static conditions but
   relatively insensitive under dynamic loadings. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A fault diagnosis method based on genetic algorithms (GAs) and a model
   of damaged ( cracked) structure is proposed. For modeling the
   cracked-beam structure an analytical model of a cracked cantilever beam
   is utilized and natural frequencies are obtained through numerical
   methods. Our method utilizes genetic algorithms to monitor the possible
   changes in the natural frequencies of the structure. The identification
   of the crack location and depth in the cantilever beam is formulated as
   an optimization problem, and binary and continuous genetic algorithms
   (BGA, CGA) are used to find the optimal location and depth by minimizing
   the cost function which is based on the difference of measured and
   calculated natural frequencies. Also we present a new cost function
   based on natural frequencies. The average values of location and depth
   prediction errors are 1.02\% and 1.98\%, respectively, using the BGA.
   These values become 0.73\% and 1.11\% for the CGA. To validate the
   proposed method and investigate the modeling and measurement errors some
   experimental results are also included. The average values of
   experimental location and depth prediction errors are 10.57\% and

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is the development of suitable mechanical models
   able to reproduce and, hence, to predict the response of masonry
   structures. In particular, the study is addressed to the modelling of
   strengthened masonry structures in which the introduction of new types
   of reinforcement, particularly the FRP (fibre-reinforced plastic)
   materials, strongly affects the structural response through complex
   interaction mechanisms between masonry and strengthening elements.
   In this paper two different approaches able to model the behaviour of
   un-reinforced and reinforced masonry structures are proposed. The first
   one is based on a micro-mechanical and multiscale analysis combined with
   the use of the kinematic and static theorems of the limit analysis; in
   this case a rigid-perfectly plastic constitutive relationship is
   considered for the masonry material and for the FRP-masonry interaction.
   The second approach is based on the use of macroscopic models. In this
   case, the constitutive relationship for the masonry material accounts
   for the softening effect throughout the use of a smeared crack approach.
   Moreover, different modelling strategies and constitutive laws are
   adopted for the FRP-reinforcement addressing particular regard to the
   delamination phenomenon.
   Numerical computations are developed for un-strengthened and
   FRP-strengthened masonry panels. The obtained results, in terms of the
   global response of the examined panels, are compared with the data
   available from experimental tests and interesting aspects are remarked.

Abstract = {{A recently developed FE-based mesostructural model for the mechanical
   behavior of heterogeneous quasi-brittle materials is used systematically
   to analyze concrete specimens in 2D. The numerical model is based on the
   use of zero-thickness interface elements equipped with a normal-shear
   traction-separation constitutive law representing non-linear fracture,
   which may be considered a mixed-mode generalization of Hillerborg's
   ``Fictitious Crack Model.{''} Specimens with 4 x 4 and 6 x 6 arrays of
   aggregates are discretized into finite elements. Interface elements are
   inserted along the main lines in the mesh, representing potential crack
   lines. The calculations presented in this paper consist of uniaxial
   tension loading, and the continuum elements themselves are assumed to
   behave as linear elastic. In this way, the influence of various aspects
   of the heterogeneous geometry and interface parameters on the overall
   specimen response has been investigated. These aspects are aggregate
   volume fraction, type of arrangement and geometry, interface layout, and
   values of the crack model parameters chosen for both the
   aggregate-aggregate and matrix-aggregate interfaces. The results show a
   good qualitative agreement with experimental observations and illustrate
   the capabilities of the model. In the companion second part of the
   paper, the model is used to represent other loading states such as
   uniaxial compression, Brazilian test, or biaxial loading.}},

   investigated using a micromechanics-based damage model accounting for
   the effect of the void aspect ratio and void distribution. The 2024-T351
   Al alloy contains precipitation free bands in which most void nucleating
   particles are located. The presence of these bands, which are parallel

   and overall fracture anisotropy. The primary void nucleating particles
   also present a preferential elongation in the rolling direction. These

   the fracture behaviour are elucidated by means of FE cell calculations.

Abstract = {{Composite laminates manufactured from thin-ply prepregs are expected to

   applicability of thin-ply prepregs to aircraft structures. Specifically,
   compressive strengths of open hole laminates (OHC strength) and
   laminates after impact loadings (CAI strength) are investigated by the
   comparison of results between laminates manufactured from the thin-ply
   prepregs and the standard prepregs. It is shown that laminates using
   thin-ply prepregs have superior strength compared to those using

Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{920-935}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a new cohesive model to stably and accurately
   simulate the delamination propagations in composite laminates under
   quasi-static and low-velocity impact transverse loads using
   comparatively coarse meshes. In this model, a pre-softening zone ahead
   of the existing traditional softening zone is proposed. In this
   pre-softening zone, the initial stiffnesses and the interface strengths
   at the integration points of cohesive elements are gradually reduced as
   the corresponding effective relative displacements at these points
   increase. However, the onset displacement corresponding to the onset
   damage is not changed in this model. Moreover, the fracture toughness of
   materials for determining the final displacement of complete decohesion
   is kept constant. This cohesive model is implemented in the explicit
   time integration scheme combined with a powerful three-dimensional (3D)
   hybrid finite element for evaluating the delamination propagations on
   interfaces in composite laminates. A DCB problem is employed to analyze
   the characteristics of the present cohesive model. In order to reduce
   the computational cost for dealing with more complex problems, a
   stress-based criterion is also adopted in our numerical model for
   evaluating various in-plane damages, such as matrix cracks, fiber
   breakage, etc, Finally, two experimental examples are employed to
   illustrate the validity of the present approach. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A Lamb wave-based technique was developed for detecting damages in
   metallic structures, such as cracks and holes in metallic beams and
   plates. For metallic structures with transverse cracks and holes, A(0)
   mode of Lamb waves was employed due to its shorter wave length compared
   with S-0 mode, which leads to high sensitivity to small damages. Two
   kinds of excitation techniques for generating comparatively pure A(0)
   mode using piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate (PZT) actuators were
   realized experimentally. In one technique, two PZT actuators with
   applied out-of-phase voltages were attached on both sides of the
   structures. While in the other technique, a kind of grease lubricant was
   used between the bottom surface of one PZT actuator and the surface of
   the specimens. Both techniques were able to enhance the component of
   A(0) mode and reduce the component of S-0 mode effectively. Secondly, in
   terms of the arrival time of the A(0) wave mode reflected from damages
   obtained using the wavelet analysis, the positions of damages were
   identified accurately. The above two techniques were then validated by
   identifying the transverse cracks and holes in aluminum beams and
   plates, respectively. Numerical simulations using the finite element
   method (FEM) for the wave propagation in these structures with damages
   were carried out. The obtained experimental and numerical results
   demonstrate that it is possible to identify damage position very
   accurately by using only sensor data of defective structures without
   referring benchmark signals (sensor data of intact structures).}},

Abstract = {{As failure criterion for sheet metal forming, conventional forming limit
   diagrams (FLD) are often used. The FLD is a strain based criterion,
   which evaluates the principal deformations at failure. Different
   investigations show that the FLD is dependent on the forming history and
   strain path. However, this is not the case for forming limit stress
   diagrams (FLSD). For this failure criterion, the principal stresses at
   failure are determined by FEM simulation of the Nakazima-test. Both, the
   FLD and the FLSD experimental investigations provide the basis for the
   sheet metal failure criterion. In contrast, continuum damage mechanics
   describe the damage evolution in the microstructure with physical
   equations, so that crack initiation due to mechanical loading can be
   predicted. By using the Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman (GTN) damage
   mechanical model, a failure criterion based on void evolution was
   examined in this work. The parameter identification for the damage model
   will be discussed. The investigations demonstrate that FLD is
   inapplicable for complex forming processes with strain path changes. The
   FLSD is better suitable than the FLD for multi step forming processes.
   Micro-mechanical damage modelling with the GTN model also shows
   acceptable formability predictions, in spite of its generally
   insufficient consideration of the effective deviatoric stress fractions.
   The quality of failure prediction using continuum damage mechanics
   models is able to be increased by applying a more suitable damage models
   and a modern overall-scale modelling approach. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The present study deals with the formulation of a new micromechanical
   model for anisotropic damage in brittle rocks and its numerical
   implementation and application. The basic idea is to integrate Eshelby
   solution-based homogenization approaches into the standard
   thermodynamics framework for the description of inelastic deformation
   contributed by microcracks; the anisotropic damage is coupled with
   frictional sliding which occurs on closed cracks. The identification of
   the micromechanical model requires only six parameters, each with a
   clear physical meaning. Comparisons of the model's predictions with
   experimental data are performed on both conventional and true triaxial
   compression paths, respectively, for two granites. The proposed model is
   implemented into the finite element software Abaqus. Its application to
   an underground excavation problem shows that the proposed model is able
   to describe general responses and damaged zone evolution due to
   excavation. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The traditional methods for analyzing deformation in structures attempt
   to solve the partial differential equations of the classical theory of
   continuum mechanics. Yet these equations, because they require the
   partial derivatives of displacement to be known throughout the region
   modeled, are in some ways unsuitable for the modeling of discontinuities
   caused by damage, in which these derivatives fail to exist. As a means
   of avoiding this limitation, the peridynamic model of solid mechanics
   has been developed for applications involving discontinuities. The
   objective of this method is to treat crack and fracture as just another
   type of deformation, rather than as pathology that requires special
   mathematical treatment. The peridynamic theory is based on integral
   equations so there is no problem in applying the equations across
   discontinuities. The peridynamic method has been applied successfully to
   damage and failure analysis in composites. It predicts in detail the
   delamination and matrix damage process in composite laminates due to low
   velocity impact, and the simulation results of damage area correlates
   very well with the experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study was carried out to determine the open hole tension
   (OHT) characteristics of carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) and high
   strength S2-glass fibre-reinforced plastic (GFRP). Tests to failure and
   percentages of ultimate load were carried out and non-destructive
   techniques were used to map damage progression. it was found that the
   CFRP OHT specimens were stronger, while the GFRP OHT specimens had
   greater ultimate strain. However, damage progression mechanisms in the
   two material systems were very similar. This is in contrast with
   previous findings on E-glass composites, indicating that S2-glass FRP
   notched failure behaviour is closer to a high-performance CFRP. Higher
   levels of damage formation prior to failure were found to result in
   higher OHT strength (S(OHT)). Blocked- ply stacking sequences were found
   to give higher damage levels and SOHT than sub-laminate level stacking
   sequences, and similar trends were found when laminate thickness was
   reduced. Non-linear transverse behaviour in GFRP resulted in lower
   levels of matrix cracking in OHT specimen 90 degrees plies, compared to
   CFRP, providing a barrier to the growth of stress relieving axial splits
   in 0 degrees plies. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mode shape-based structural damage identification has been a research
   focus during the last couple of decades. Most of the existing methods
   need a numerical or measured baseline mode shape serving as a reference
   to identify damage, and this requirement extremely limits the
   practicability of the methods. Recently, waveform fractal dimension such
   as Katz's waveform fractal dimension (KWD) has been explored and applied
   to mode shape for crack identification without a baseline requirement.
   In this study, different from the popular KWD, an approximate waveform
   capacity dimension (AWCD) is formulated first, from which an AWCD-based
   modal abnormality algorithm (AWCD-MAA) is systematically established.
   Then, the basic characteristics of AWCD-MAA on abnormality detection of
   mode shapes, e.g., crack localization, crack quantification, noise
   immunity, etc., are investigated based on an analytical crack model of
   cantilever beams using linear elastic fracture mechanics. In particular,
   from the perspective of isomorphism, a mathematical solution on the use
   of applying waveform fractal dimension to higher mode shapes for crack
   identification is originally proposed, from which the inherent
   deficiency of waveform fractal dimension to identify crack when
   implemented to higher mode shapes is overcome. The applicability and
   effectiveness of the AWCD-MAA is validated by an experimental program on
   damage identification of a cracked composite cantilever beam using smart
   piezoelectric sensors/actuators (i.e., Piezoelectric
   lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)). The
   proposed AWCD-MAA provides a novel, viable method for crack
   identification of beam-type structures without baseline requirement, and
   it largely expands the scope of fractal in structural health monitoring
   applications. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Woven glass fabric reinforced epoxy composite laminates were provided
   with crack healing capability by pre-dispersing a novel repair system in

   CuBr(2) and 2-methylimidazole). Compression after impact (CAI) tests
   were conducted to evaluate mechanical performance of the laminates
   before and after crack healing. Moreover, healing efficiency was studied
   as a function of impact energy, repair pressure, content and size of the
   microencapsulated epoxy. The experimental results indicated that the
   healing agent worked in repairing matrix cracks generated by impact. The
   composites should be heated to 140 degrees C for 0.5 h to achieve
   healing and moderate pressure was needed to close larger crack damage

Abstract = {{The paper presents experimental results of self-healing process of
   concrete damaged at different ages. Essentially, the self-healing of
   damaged concrete is processes of crack closing with re-hydration
   products of unhydrated or insufficiently-hydrated cementitious particles
   in damaged regions. Damage degree was measured from decrease in
   ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) before and after loading, and the
   self-healing effect was deduced from the strength increment after
   self-healing by introducing a self-healing ratio. The relationship
   between damage degree and self-healing ratio of concrete was built based
   upon the experimental results. Analyses of test results show that there
   exists a damage threshold both for high strength concrete and normal
   strength concrete. When the damage degree is less than the threshold,
   the self-healing ratio of concrete is increased with the increase in
   damage degree; while the damage degree exceeds the threshold, the
   self-healing ratio is decreased with the increase in damage degree. The
   damage threshold for normal strength concrete is higher than that for
   high strength concrete. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Some modifications to the Holmquist-Johnson-Cook (HJC) model (1993) for
   concrete under impact loading conditions are proposed. First, the
   pressure-shear behaviour is enhanced by including the influence of the
   third deviatoric stress invariant to take into account the substantial
   shear strength difference between the tensile and compressive meridians.
   Second, the modelling of strain-rate sensitivity is slightly changed so
   that the strain-rate enhancement factor goes to unity for zero strain
   rate. Third, three damage variables describing the tensile cracking,
   shear cracking and pore compaction mechanisms are introduced. A critical
   review of the constitutive model with alternative proposals for
   parameter identification is given. The model parameters are obtained for
   two concrete qualities, and perforation of concrete slabs is considered
   numerically and compared with experimental results from the literature.
   Ballistic limit assessments with deviations under 8\% when compared to
   the experimental results are obtained, indicating that the modified
   version of the HJC concrete model represents a good compromise between
   simplicity and accuracy for large-scale computations of concrete plates

Abstract = {{Solid propellants are composite materials with complex microstructure.
   In a generic form, the material consists of polymeric binder, crystal
   oxidizer (e.g., ammonium perchlorate), and fuel particles (e.g.,
   aluminum). Severe stressing and extreme temperatures induce damage which
   is manifested in particle cracking, dewetting along particle/polymer
   interfaces, void nucleation and growth. Damage complicates the overall
   constitutive response of a solid propellant over and above the
   complexities associated with the differing constitutive properties of
   the particle and binder phases. Using rigorous homogenization theory for
   composite materials, we propose a general 3-D nonlinear macroscopic
   constitutive law that models microstructural damage evolution upon
   straining through continuous void formation and growth. The law
   addresses the viscous deformation rate within the framework of additive
   decomposition of the deformation rate and the concept of back stress is
   used to improve the model performance in stress relaxation. No
   restriction is placed on the magnitude of the strains. Experimental data
   from the standard relaxation and uniaxial tension tests are used to
   calibrate the model parameters in the case of a high elongation solid
   propellant. It is emphasized that the model parameters are descriptors
   of individual phase constitutive response and criticality conditions for
   particle decohesion which can systematically be determined through
   experiment. The model is used to predict the response of the material
   under more complex loading paths and to investigate the effect of crack
   tip damage on the mechanical behavior of a compact tension fracture
   specimen. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A constitutive model for concrete subjected to cyclic loadings in both
   compression and tension is presented. The proposed model is intended to
   provide improvements on modelling the cyclic behaviour of concrete
   structures in the context of computational programs based on a smeared
   crack approach. Particular emphasis has been paid to the description of
   the strength and stiffness degradation produced by the load cycling in
   both tension and compression, the shape of unloading and reloading
   curves and the transition between opening and closing of cracks. Two
   independent damage parameters in compression and in tension have been
   introduced to model the concrete degradation due to increasing loads. In
   the case of cyclic compressive loading, the model has been derived from
   experimental results obtained by other authors by considering the
   dependency of the cyclic variables with the damage level attained by the
   concrete. In the case of cyclic tension a simple model is adopted based
   on experimental observations. The main novelty of the proposed
   constitutive model lays in the fact that all the required input data can
   be obtained through the conventional monotonic compression and tension

Abstract = {{A model devoted to the prediction of the high temperature creep-fatigue
   lifetime of modified 9Cr-Mo martensitic steels is proposed. This model
   is built on the basis of the physical mechanisms responsible for damage
   due to the interaction of creep, fatigue and oxidation. These mechanisms
   were identified thanks to detailed observations previously reported in
   part I and part 11 of this study. These observations led to the
   distinction of two main domains, corresponding to two distinct types of
   interaction between creep, fatigue and oxidation. As no intergranular
   creep damage can be observed in the tested loading range, the proposed
   modelling consists in the prediction of the number of cycles necessary
   for the initiation and the propagation of transgranular fatigue cracks.
   Propagation rate measurements under high stress low-cycle fatigue
   conditions were carried out to calibrate the Tomkins model used to
   predict the life spent in crack propagation, whereas the initiation
   stage is predicted using the model proposed by Tanaka and Mura. The
   predictions obtained compare very favorably with the experimental
   creep-fatigue lifetimes. Finally the extrapolations and limits of the

Abstract = {{The introduction of controlled gradients in plastic properties is known
   to influence the resistance to damage and cracking at contact surfaces
   in many tribological applications. In order to assess potentially
   beneficial effects of plastic property gradients in tribological
   applications, it is essential first to develop a comprehensive and
   quantitative understanding of the effects of yield strength and strain
   hardening exponent on contact deformation under the most fundamental
   contact condition: normal indentation. To date, however, systematic and
   quantitative studies of plasticity gradient effects on indentation
   response have not been completed. A comprehensive parametric study of
   the mechanics of normal indentation of plastically graded materials was
   therefore undertaken in this work by recourse to finite element method
   (FEM) computations. On the basis of a large number of computational
   simulations, a general methodology for assessing instrumented
   indentation response of plastically graded materials is formulated so
   that quantitative interpretations of depth-sensing indentation
   experiments could be performed. The specific case of linear variation in
   yield strength with depth below the indented surface is explored in
   detail. Universal dimensionless functions are extracted from FEM
   simulations so as to predict the indentation load versus depth of
   penetration curves for a wide variety of plastically graded engineering
   metals and alloys for interpretation of, and comparisons with,
   experimental results. Furthermore, the effect of plasticity gradient on
   the residual indentation pile-up profile is systematically studied. The
   computations reveal that pile-up of the graded alloy around the
   indenter, for indentation with increasing yield strength beneath the
   surface, is noticeably higher than that for the two homogeneous
   reference materials that constitute the bounding conditions for the
   graded material. Pile-up is also found to be an increasing function of
   yield strength gradient and a decreasing function of frictional
   coefficient. The stress and plastic strain distributions under the
   indenter tip with and without plasticity gradient are also examined to
   rationalize the predicted trends. In Part 11 of this paper, we compare
   the predictions of depth-sensing indentation and pile-up response with
   experiments on a specially made, graded model Ni-W alloy with controlled
   gradients in nanocrystalline grain size. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All

Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{it is generally accepted that the fatigue crack growth (FCG) depends
   mainly on the stress intensity factor range (Delta K) and the maximum
   stress intensity factor (K-max). The two parameters are usually combined
   into one expression called often as the driving force and many various
   driving forces have been proposed up to date. The driving force can be
   successful as long as the stress intensity factors are appropriately
   correlated with the actual elasto-plastic crack tip stress-strain field.
   However, the correlation between the stress intensity factors and the
   crack tip stress-strain field is often influenced by residual stresses
   induced in due course.
   A two-parameter (Delta K-tot, K-max,K-tot) driving force based on the
   elasto-plastic crack tip stress-strain history has been proposed. The
   applied stress intensity factors (Delta K-appl, K-max,K-appl) were
   modified to the total stress intensity factors (Delta K-tot,
   K-max,K-tot) in order to account for the effect of the local crack tip
   stresses and strains on fatigue crack growth. The FCG was predicted by
   simulating the stress-strain response in the material volume adjacent to
   the crack tip and estimating the accumulated fatigue damage. The fatigue
   crack growth was regarded as a process of successive crack
   re-initiations in the crack tip region. The model was developed to
   predict the effect of the mean and residual stresses induced by the
   cyclic loading. The effect of variable amplitude loadings on FCG can be
   also quantified on the basis of the proposed model. A two-parameter
   driving force in the form of. Delta kappa = K-max, tot(p) Delta
   K-tot((l-p)) was derived based on the local stresses and strains at the
   crack tip and the Smith-Watson-Topper (SWT) fatigue damage parameter: D
   = sigma(max)Delta epsilon/2. The effect of the internal (residual)
   stress induced by the reversed cyclic plasticity manifested itself in
   the change of the resultant (total) stress intensity factors controlling
   the fatigue crack growth.
   The model was verified using experimental fatigue crack growth data for
   aluminum alloy 7075-T6 obtained under constant amplitude loading and a
   single overload. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic guided wave modes are proposed to control the integrity of
   high-pressure composite tanks produced by EADS-ASTRIUM, France. The
   purpose is to demonstrate the potentiality of air-coupled transducers to
   set Lip a contact-less, single-sided technique for testing the moisture
   content and/or the micro-cracking of carbon-epoxy composite wound around
   a Titanium liner. Although guided waves have been experimentally
   propagated on a real tank, it was not allowed to damage this specimen.
   Therefore, plates made of similar composite materials than that
   Constituting the tank winding were Submitted to water intake or to
   thermal stresses. After immersing some plates in a humid chamber, it was
   demonstrated that the attenuation of the A(0) guided wave mode is
   sensitive to the moisture content. Other plate samples were Submitted to
   immersion in liquid nitrogen that induces transversal cracks shown to
   cause significant drops in the celerity of several guided waves. Inverse
   problems have been used for quantifying the effects of these damages on
   the material properties, and they showed that water intake increases the
   imaginary part of the Coulomb moduli, while micro-cracking decreases all
   the material stiffness moduli. Such changes in the material properties
   have then been used as input data for simulating waveforms corresponding
   to the propagation Of Circumferential or longitudinal wave modes in the
   tank. Changes in these waveforms, caused by simulated damages of the
   composite winding of the tank, have been shown to be quite significant.
   To conclude the study, an experimental sep-up using air-coupled
   transducers was employed to generate-detect guided wave modes over large
   distances in the real tank, with very good signal-to-noise ratios, thus
   demonstrating the possibility of using Such elements for the
   non-destructive testing of high-pressure composite tanks during their

Abstract = {{This article proposes a fully three-dimensional continuum damage model,

   based on the assumption that the composite material is transversely

   element code taking into account the requirement to ensure a
   mesh-independent computation of the dissipated energy. The comparison
   between the model predictions and published experimental data indicates
   that the model can accurately predict the effects of transverse matrix

Abstract = {{Novel experimental possibilities together with improvements in computer
   hardware as well as new concepts in computational mathematics and
   mechanics - in particular multiscale methods - are now, in principle,
   making it possible to derive and compute phenomena and material
   parameters at a macroscopic level from processes that take place one to
   several scales below. Because of this quest to analyse and quantify
   material behaviour at ever lower scales, more often (evolving)
   discontinuities have to be taken into account explicitly. Also, many
   applications require that one or more diffusion-like phenomena are
   considered in addition to a standard stress analysis. Accordingly,
   multiscale analysis, multi-physics and the ability to explicitly and
   accurately model evolving discontinuities are important challenges in
   computational science, and further progress on these topics is
   indispensible for an improved understanding of the behaviour and
   properties of materials. In this contribution we will give an impression

Abstract = {{Steel corrosion in reinforced concrete structures leads to severe
   degradation processes which usually affect both the ultimate and
   serviceability limit state performance of the whole construction.
   Numerical modelling of such a behaviour requires effective non linear
   models able to capture all the main effects of corrosion (i.e. cracking,
   reduction in bond strength, reduction in steel cross-section, bond
   degradation, etc.). This paper discusses these topics by focusing on the
   effects of corrosion on bond behaviour. In particular, a coupled
   mechanical-environmental damage model is used to simulate the
   deterioration of concrete (i.e. cover cracking and reduction of
   mechanical properties), while the effects of corrosion on bond behaviour
   have been dealt with using two different approaches, one based on a
   ``frictional type{''} law and the other on a ``damage type{''} law. A
   comparison between experimental pull-out test data and numerical results
   verifies that the proposed procedures can effectively simulate the
   effects of corrosion on bond behaviour, mainly for the ``damage type{''}
   approach. Finally the numerical simulation of some experimental tests of
   corroded beam has been carried out. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Barenblatt and Botvina with elegant dimensional analysis arguments have
   elucidated that Paris' power-law is a weak form of scaling, so that the
   Paris' parameters C and m should not be taken as material constants. On
   the contrary, they are expected to depend on all the dimensionless
   parameters of the problem, and are really ``constants{''} only within
   some specific ranges of all these. In the present paper, the dimensional
   analysis approach by Barenblatt and Botvina is generalized to explore
   the functional dependencies of m and C on more dimensionless parameters
   than the original Barenblatt and Botvina, and experimental results are
   interpreted for a wider range of materials including both metals and
   concrete. In particular, we find that the size-scale dependencies of m
   and C and the resulting correlation between C and m are quite different
   for metals and for quasi-brittle materials, as it is already suggested
   from the fact the fatigue crack propagation processes lead to m = 2-5 in
   metals and m = 10-50 in quasi-brittle materials, Therefore, according to
   the concepts of complete and incomplete self-similarities, the
   experimentally observed breakdowns of the classical Paris' law are
   discussed and interpreted within a unified theoretical framework.
   Finally, we show that most attempts to address the deviations from the
   Paris' law or the empirical correlations between the constants can be
   explained with this approach. We also suggest that ``incomplete
   similarity{''} corresponds to the difficulties encountered so far by the
   ``damage tolerant{''} approach which, after nearly 50 years since the
   introduction of Paris' law, is still not a reliable calculation of
   damage, as Paris himself admits in a recent review. (c) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In the present comparative study, we investigate the influence of
   directional mesh bias on the results of failure simulations performed
   with isotropic and anisotropic damage models. Several fracture tests
   leading to curved crack trajectories are simulated on different meshes.
   The isotropic damage model with a realistic biaxial strength envelope
   for concrete is highly sensitive to the mesh orientation, even for fine
   meshes. The sensitivity is reduced if the definition of the
   damage-driving variable (equivalent stain) is based on the modified von
   Mises criterion, but the corresponding biaxial strength envelope is not
   realistic for concrete. The anisotropic damage models used in this study
   capture reasonably well arbitrary crack trajectories even if the biaxial
   strength envelope remains close to typical experimental data. Their
   superior performance can be at least partially attributed to their
   ability to capture dilatancy under shear, which is revealed by a
   comparative analysis of the behavior of individual models under shear
   with restricted or free volume expansion. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Response-only method for damage detection of beam-like structures using
   high accuracy frequencies with auxiliary mass spatial probing}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{311}},
Number = {{3-5}},

Month = {{APR 8}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new approach based on auxiliary mass spatial
   probing using spectral centre correction method (SCCM), to provide a
   simple solution for damage detection by just using the response time
   history of beam-like structures. The natural frequencies of a damaged
   beam with a traversing auxiliary mass change due to change in the
   inertia of the beam as the auxiliary mass is traversed along the beam,
   as well as the point-to-point variations in the flexibility of the beam.
   Therefore the auxiliary mass call enhance the effects of the crack on
   the dynamics of the beam and, therefore, facilitate the identification
   and location of damage in the beam. That is, the auxiliary mass can be
   used to probe the dynamic characteristic of the beam by traversing the
   mass from one end of the beam to the other. However, it is impossible to
   obtain accurate modal frequencies by the direct operation of the fast
   Fourier transform (FFT) of the response data of the structure because
   the frequency spectrum can be only calculated from limited sampled time
   data which results in the well-known leakage effect. SCCM is identical
   to the energy centrobaric correction method (ECCM) which is a practical
   and effective method used in rotating mechanical fault diagnosis and
   which resolves the shortcoming of FFT and can provide high accuracy
   estimate of frequency, amplitude and phase. In the present work, the
   modal responses of damaged simply supported beams with auxiliary mass
   are computed using the finite element method (FEM). The graphical plots
   of the natural frequencies calculated by SCCM versus axial location of
   auxiliary mass are obtained. However, it is difficult to locate the
   crack directly from the curve of natural frequencies. A simple and fast
   method, the derivatives of natural frequency curve, is proposed in the
   paper which can provide crack information for damage detection of
   beam-like structures. The efficiency and practicability of the proposed
   method is illustrated via numerical simulation. For real cases,
   experimental noise is expected to corrupt the response data and,
   ultimately, the natural frequencies of beam-like structures. Therefore,
   the response data with a normally distributed random noise is also
   studied. Also, the effects of crack depth, auxiliary mass and damping
   ratios oil the proposed method are investigated. From the simulated
   results, the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method is
   demonstrated. The results show that the proposed method has low
   computational cost and high precision. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Natural frequencies of a damaged simply supported beam with a stationary
   roving mass are studied theoretically. The transverse deflection of the
   cracked beam is constructed by adding a polynomial function, which
   represents the effects of a crack, to the polynomial function which
   represents the response of the intact beam {[}J. Fernandez-Saez, L.
   Rubio, C. Navarro, Approximate calculation of the fundamental
   frequencies for bending vibrations of cracked beams, Journal of Sound
   and Vibration 225 (1999) 345-352]. By means of the boundary and
   kinematics conditions, approximate closed-form analytical expressions
   are derived for the natural frequencies of an arbitrary mode of
   transverse vibration of a cracked simply supported beam with a roving
   mass using the Rayleigh's method. The natural frequencies change due to
   the roving of the mass along the cracked beam. Therefore the roving mass
   can provide additional spatial information for damage detection of the
   beam. That is, the roving mass can be used to probe the dynamic
   characteristics of the beam by roving the mass from one end of the beam
   to the other. The presence of a crack causes the local stiffness of the
   beam to decrease which, in turn, causes a marked decrease in natural
   frequency of the beam when the roving mass is located in the vicinity of
   the crack. The magnitude of the roving mass used varied between 0\% and
   50\% of the mass of the beam. The predicted frequencies are shown to
   compare very well with those obtained using the finite element method
   and the experimental results. Finally, the effects of crack depth, crack
   location and roving mass on the natural frequency of the beam are
   investigated. It is shown that the natural frequencies of the cracked
   beam decrease as the crack depth increases and as the roving mass is
   traversed closer to the crack location. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{An experimental study was conducted to study the improvement of damage
   resistance in laminated composites with the addition of electrospun
   nano-interlayers as the interleave material. The electrospinning process
   was utilized to fabricate nanofibers and nanofibril mats with and
   without the CNTs by using three thermoplastic polymers: polycarbonate,
   poly(phenylene oxide) and polystyrene. The optimal mixture ratio of the
   solvent and concentration of the CNTs was found to yield optimal fiber
   formation. It was observed that the fiber becomes thicker with the
   increase of polymer concentration and the CNT contents. Mechanical tests
   under Uniaxial tensile loading were carried out with a
   delamination-prone layup of {[}30/-30/90/90/-30/30](T) by placing the
   polycarbonate electrospun nanofibril mats at the interface between each
   ply. The difference in total thickness of the laminates with and without
   five nano-interlayers was less than 0.001 mm, which is negligibly thin.
   The stress levels at the first microcracking damage, delamination damage
   and ultimate load-drop increased by 8.4\%, 8.1\% and 9.8\%,
   respectively, with the addition of the nano-interlayers as compared with
   the pristine specimens. The number of rnicrocracks decreased
   significantly with the addition of the nano-interlayers. The increase of
   the FPF strength with the nano-interlayers was analyzed with the Weibull
   statistical theory and the prediction agreed well with the experimental

Title = {{Integrated wavelet transform and its application to vibration mode
   shapes for the damage detection of beam-type structures}},

Abstract = {{Wavelet analysis has been extensively used in damage detection due to
   its inherent merits over traditional Fourier transforms, and it has been
   applied to identify abnormality from vibration mode shapes in structural
   damage identification. However, most related studies have only
   demonstrated its ability to identify the abnormality of retrieved mode
   shapes with a relatively higher signal-to-noise ratio, and its
   incapability of identifying slight abnormality usually corrupted by
   noise is still a challenge. In this paper, a new technique (so-called
   `integrated wavelet transform (IWT)') of taking synergistic advantages
   of the stationary wavelet transform (SWT) and the continuous wavelet
   transform (CWT) is proposed to improve the robustness of abnormality
   analysis of mode shapes in damage detection. Two progressive wavelet
   analysis steps are considered, in which SWT-based multiresolution
   analysis (MRA) is first employed to refine the retrieved mode shapes,
   followed by CWT-based multiscale analysis (MSA) to magnify the effect of
   slight abnormality. The SWT-MRA is utilized to separate the
   multicomponent modal signal, eliminate random noise and regular
   interferences, and thus extract purer damage information, while the
   CWT-MSA is employed to smoothen, differentiate or suppress polynomials
   of mode shapes to magnify the effect of abnormality. The choice of the
   optimal mother wavelet in damage detection is also elaborately
   addressed. The proposed methodology of the IWT is evaluated using the
   mode shape data from the numerical finite element analysis and
   experimental testing of a cantilever beam with a through-width crack.
   The methodology presented provides a robust and viable technique to
   identify minor damage in a relatively lower signal-to-noise ratio
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{Equivalent crack based data reduction schemes have been recently
   proposed for mode 11 interlaminar fracture tests. These methods avoid
   the difficulties in monitoring crack propagation throughout the test, as
   the experimental compliance data is used to calculate the crack
   position. However, their accuracy has not been demonstrated. In this
   paper, application of equivalent crack approaches to End-Notched Flexure
   and End-Loaded Split tests was studied numerically. A cohesive zone
   damage model based on developed interface finite elements was used.
   Equivalent crack methods were found to be very accurate for both
   specimens, while classical beam theory based data reduction schemes
   underestimated fracture toughness. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Fretting tests have been conducted to determine the maximum crack
   extension under partial slip conditions, as a function of the applied
   tangential force amplitude. An analytical elastic model representing a
   fretting-induced slant crack has been implemented and combined with the
   Kitagawa-Takahashi short crack methodology. This approach provides
   reasonable qualitative agreement between experimental and predicted
   maximum fretting crack lengths as long as the global response of the
   interface remains elastic. It confirms the stability of the crack arrest
   approach to predict the fretting fatigue endurance. It is, however,
   observed that the model is systematically conservative when significant
   plastic deformations are generated in the interface. A discussion of the
   appropriate fundamental parameters when dealing with steep stress
   gradients such as those present in fretting, and which are difficult to
   interpret in the context of the Kitagawa-Takahashi method, is presented.
   It is also shown that the maximum crack length evolution under plain
   fretting wear test conditions can be used to calibrate fretting fatigue
   predictions.(C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},
