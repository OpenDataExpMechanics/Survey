Abstract = {{A reliable numerical damage model has been developed for adhesively
   bonded joints under fatigue loading that is only dependant on the
   adhesive system and not on joint configuration. A bi-linear
   traction-separation description of a cohesive zone model was employed to
   simulate progressive damage in the adhesively bonded joints.
   Furthermore, a strain-based fatigue damage model was integrated with the
   cohesive zone model to simulate the deleterious influence of the fatigue
   loading on the bonded joints. To obtain the damage model parameters and
   validate the methodology, carefully planned experimental tests on
   coupons cut from a bonded panel and separately manufactured single lap
   joints were undertaken. Various experimental techniques have been used
   to assess joint damage including the back-face strain technique and in
   situ video microscopy. It was found that the fatigue damage model was
   able to successfully predict the fatigue life and the evolving back-face
   strain and hence the evolving damage. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The interfacial fracture of adhesively bonded structures is a critical
   issue for the extensive applications to a variety of modern industries.
   In the recent two decades, cohesive zone models (CZMs) have been
   receiving intensive attentions for fracture problems of adhesively
   bonded joints. Numerous global tests have been conducted to measure the
   interfacial toughness of adhesive joints. Limited local tests have also
   been conducted to determine the interface traction-separation laws in
   adhesive joints. However, very few studies focused on the local test of
   effects of adhesive thickness on the interfacial traction-separation
   laws. Interfacial toughness and interfacial strength, as two critical
   parameters in an interfacial traction-separation law, have important
   effect on the fracture behaviors of bonded joints. In this work, the
   global and local tests are employed to investigate the effect of
   adhesive thickness on interfacial energy release rate, interfacial
   strength, and shapes of the interfacial traction-separation laws.
   Basically, the measured laws in this work reflect the equivalent and
   lumped interfacial fracture behaviors which include the cohesive
   fracture, damage and plasticity. The experimentally determined
   interfacial traction-separation laws may provide valuable baseline data
   for the parameter calibrations in numerical models. The current
   experimental results may also facilitate the understanding of adhesive
   thickness-dependent interface fracture of bonded joints. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{By extending molecular-dynamics simulation to the experimental
   micrometer length scale, we observed the complete dynamics of gold films
   subjected to ultrashort (less than or similar to 1 ps) laser
   irradiation, culminating in cavitation then ablation of the melt at the
   front, and crack nucleation then spallation at the rear side of the
   sample. For thick films (>0.5 mu m) ablation and spallation are
   spatially separated; whereas for thin films, they merge into a unique
   damage process, which leads to a dependence of ablation threshold on
   film thickness. This work provides insights into thermomechanical
   dynamics of irradiated metal films, including coupling-decoupling of
   ablation and spallation processes, and opens up a field of direct
   comparison between experiment and atomistic simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Statement of problem. Traditional testing of ceramic crowns creates a
   stress state and damage modes that differ greatly from those seen
   clinically. There is a need OD develop and communicate an in vitro
   testing protocol that is clinically valid.
   Purpose. The purpose of this study was to develop an in vitro failure
   test for ceramic single-unit prostheses that duplicates the failure
   mechanism and stress state observed in clinically failed prostheses.
   This article first compares characteristics of traditional
   load-to-failure tests of ceramic crowns with the growing body of
   evidence regarding failure origins and stress states at failure from the
   examination of clinically failed crowns, finite element analysis (FEA),
   and data from clinical studies. Based on this analysis, an experimental
   technique was systematically developed and test materials were
   identified to recreate key aspects of clinical failure in vitro.
   Material and methods. One potential dentin analog material (an epoxy
   filled with woven glass fibers; NEMA grade G10) was evaluated for
   elastic modulus in blunt contact and for bond strength to resin cement
   as compared to hydrated dentin. Two bases with different elastic moduli
   (nickel chrome and resin-based composite) were tested for influence on
   failure loads. The influence of water during storage and loading (both
   monotonic and cyclic) was examined. Loading piston materials (G10,
   aluminum, stainless steel) and piston designs were varied to eliminate
   Hertzian cracking and to improve performance. Testing was extended from
   a monolayer ceramic (leucite-filled glass) to a bilayer ceramic system
   (glass-infiltrated alumina). The influence of cyclic rate on mean
   failure loads was examined (2 Hz, 10 Hz, 20 Hz) with the extremes
   compared statistically (t test; alpha=.05).
   Results. Failure loads were highly influenced by base elastic modulus (t
   test; P<.001). Cyclic loading while in water significantly decreased
   mean failure loads (1-way ANOVA; P=.003) versus wet storage/dry cycling
   (350 N vs. 1270 N). G10 was not significantly different from hydrated
   dentin in terms of blunt contact elastic behavior or resin cement bond
   strength. Testing was successful with the bilayered ceramic, and the
   cycling rate altered mean failure loads only slightly (approximately
   5\%).
   Conclusions. Test methods and materials were developed to validly
   simulate many aspects of clinical failure. (J Prosthet Dent

Abstract = {{Service life and durability of reinforced concrete structures have
   become a crucial issue because of the economical and ecological
   implications. Service life of reinforced concrete structures is often
   limited by penetration of water and chemical compounds dissolved in
   water into the porous cement-based material. By now it is well-known
   that cracks in reinforced concrete are preferential paths for ingress of
   aggressive substances. Neutron radiography was successfully applied to
   study the process of water penetration into cracked steel reinforced
   concrete. In addition, the effectiveness of integral water repellent
   concrete to prevent ingress of water and salt solutions was
   investigated. Results are described in detail in this contribution. It
   will be shown that neutron radiography is a powerful method to visualize
   the process of water penetration into cracked and uncracked cement-based
   materials. On the basis of the obtained experimental data, it is
   possible to quantify the time-dependent water distributions in concrete
   with high accuracy and spatial resolution. It is of particular interest
   that penetration of water and salt solutions into damaged interfaces
   between concrete and steel can be visualized by means of neutron
   radiography. Deteriorating processes in cracked reinforced concrete
   structures can be studied in a completely new way. This advanced
   technology will help and find adequate ways to improve durability and
   service life of reinforced concrete structures. This will mean at the
   same time an essential contribution to improved sustainabihty. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The paper demonstrates the application of cross-modulation
   vibro-acoustic technique for impact-damage detection in composite
   laminates. A composite plate is monitored for damage resulting from a
   low-velocity impact. The plate is excited simultaneously with two
   harmonic signals: a slow amplitude-modulated vibration pumping wave and
   a constant amplitude-probing wave. The frequency of both the excitation
   signals coincides with the resonances of the plate. An electromagnetic
   shaker is used to introduce the pumping wave to the plate. Two
   surface-bonded, low-profile piezoceramic transducers are used for
   probing-wave excitation and measurement. The wave modulation is
   transferred from the pumping wave to the probing wave in the presence of
   impact damage. This effect is exhibited in a power spectrum of the
   probing wave by a pattern of sidebands around the carrier harmonic. The
   results show that the amplitude of the sidebands is related to the
   severity of damage. The study also investigates also the effect of
   boundary conditions on the results.}},

Abstract = {{This manuscript investigates compression-after-impact failure in woven
   fiber-reinforced composites. Compression failure of composite structures
   previously damaged by an impact event is due to the propagation of
   impact-induced damage mechanisms such as interlaminar debonding,
   constituent (i.e., matrix and fiber) microcracking, sublaminate
   buckling, as well as the interactions between these mechanisms. The
   failure mechanisms within each ply are idealized based on a reduced
   order multiscale computational model, in which, the damage propagation
   in the matrix and fibers upon compression is explicitly modeled.
   Delamination along the ply interfaces is idealized using a cohesive
   surface model. The initial impact-induced damage within the
   microconstituents and interfaces are inferred from experimental
   observations. A suite of numerical simulations is conducted to
   understand the sublaminate buckling, propagation of delamination and
   constituent damage upon compression loading. The numerical
   investigations suggest extensive propagation of delamination with mode
   transition preceding sublaminate buckling. Initiation and propagation of
   matrix and fiber cracking, observed upon sublaminate buckling, is the
   cause of ultimate shear failure. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Elastic moduli evolution and accompanying stress changes with increasing

Abstract = {{P>The elastic moduli of rock in areas susceptible to crack damage, such
   as within fault zones or volcanic edifices, can be subject to large
   modifications. Knowledge of how elastic moduli may vary in such
   situations is important for both the reliable modelling of volcano
   deformation and stability and for linear and non-linear elastic crack
   models for earthquake rupture. Furthermore, it has previously been shown
   that changes in elastic moduli can induce changes in the stress field
   surrounding faults. Here we report both uniaxial experimental
   measurements of changes in elastic moduli during increasing-amplitude
   cyclic stressing experiments on a range of different rock types
   (basalts, sandstones and granite) and the results of modelled stress
   modifications. The trend in elastic moduli evolution with increasing
   damage was remarkably similar for each rock type, with the exception of
   essentially crack-free intrusive basalt that exhibited very minor
   changes. In general, Young's modulus decreased by between 11 and 32 per
   cent and Poisson's ratio increased by between 72 and 600 per cent over
   the total sequence of loading cycles. These changes are attributed to an
   increasing level of anisotropic crack damage within the samples. Our
   results also show that acoustic emission (AE) output during any loading
   cycle only commenced when new crack damage was generated. This
   corresponded to the level of stress where AE ceased during the unloading
   portion of the previous cycle. Using the multilayer elastic model of
   Faulkner et al. we demonstrate that the damage-induced changes in
   elastic moduli also result in significant decreases in differential
   stress, increases in mean stress and rotation of the applied greatest
   principal stress relative to the orientation of the mechanical layering.
   The similar trend in the evolution of the elastic moduli of all the
   rocks tested suggests that stress modification in the damage zone of
   faults might take the same form, regardless of the lithology through
   which the fault runs. These observations are discussed in terms of their
   applicability to both fault zones and deformation at volcanoes.}},

Abstract = {{A constitutive model to predict stiffness reduction due to transverse
   matrix cracking is derived for laminae with arbitrary orientation,
   subject to in-plane stress, embedded in laminates with symmetric but
   otherwise arbitrary laminate stacking sequence. The moduli of the
   damaged laminate are a function of the crack densities in the damaging
   laminae, which are analyzed one by one. The evolution of crack density
   in each lamina is derived in terms of the calculated strain energy
   release rate and predicted as function of the applied load using a
   fracture mechanics approach. Unlike plasticity-inspired formulations.
   the proposed model does not postulate damage evolution functions and
   thus there is no need for additional experimental data to adjust
   material parameters. All that it is needed are the elastic moduli and
   critical energy release rates for the laminae. The reduction of lamina
   stiffness is an integral part of the model, allowing for stress
   redistribution among laminae. Comparisons with experimental data and
   some results from the literature are presented. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

   discrete forces represent the interaction between fibres and matrix.
   These forces are assumed to be equal to fibre pull-out forces. With this

Abstract = {{The present paper deals with hydrogen embrittlement (HE) susceptibility
   of a high strength steel grade (X80). The respective implication of
   different hydrogen populations, i.e. adsorbed, dissolved in interstitial
   sites, trapped on dislocations and/or microstructural elements on the
   associated embrittlement mechanisms has been addressed through
   mechanical testing in high pressure of hydrogen gas at room temperature.
   Tensile tests at various strain rates and hydrogen pressures have been
   carried out. Moreover, changes of gas (hydrogen or nitrogen) during
   loading have been imposed in order to get critical experiments able to
   discriminate among the potential hydrogen embrittlement mechanisms
   already proposed in the literature. The results of these tests have
   shown that hydrogen induces several kind of damages including decohesion
   along ferrite/pearlite interfaces and microcracks initiations on the
   specimens external surface. It is shown that decohesion is not critical
   under the loading paths used in the present study. On the contrary, it
   appears that the external microcracks initiation, followed by a
   quasi-cleavage fracture, is responsible for the premature failure of the
   material in high pressure of hydrogen gas. These experimental results
   have been further discussed by modeling hydrogen diffusion in order to
   identify hydrogen populations (adsorbed, diffusible or trapped) involved
   in HE. It was then demonstrated that adsorbed and near surface
   diffusible hydrogen are mainly responsible for embrittlement. (C) 2010

Number = {{6, SI}},
Pages = {{897-905}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The single most important cause of the deterioration of monuments in the
   Mediterranean basin, and elsewhere around the world, is the
   crystallization of salt within the pores of the stone. Considerable
   advances have been made in recent years in elucidating the fundamental
   mechanisms responsible for salt damage. As a result, new methods of
   treatment are being proposed that offer the possibility of attacking the
   cause of the problem, rather than simply treating the symptoms. In this
   Account, we review the thermodynamics and kinetics of crystallization,
   then examine how a range of technological innovations have been applied
   experimentally to further the current understanding of in-pore
   crystallization. We close with a discussion of how computer modeling now
   provides particularly valuable insight, including quantitative estimates
   of both the interaction forces between the mineral and the crystal and
   the stresses induced in the material.
   Analyzing the kinetics and thermodynamics of crystal growth within the
   pores of a stone requires sensitive tools used in combination. For
   example, calorimetry quantifies the amount of salt that precipitates in
   the pores of a stone during cooling, and dilatometric measurements on a
   companion sample reveal the stress exerted by the salt. Synchrotron
   X-rays can penetrate the stone and identify the metastable phases that
   often appear in the first stages of crystallization. Atomic force
   microscopy and environmental scanning electron microscopy permit study
   of the nanometric liquid film that typically lies between salt and
   stone; this film controls the magnitude of the pressure exerted and the
   kinetics of relaxation of the stress. These experimental advances
   provide validation for increasingly advanced simulations, using
   continuum models of reactive transport on a macroscopic scale and
   molecular dynamics on the atomic scale.
   Because of the fundamental understanding of the damage mechanisms that
   is beginning to emerge, it is possible to devise methods for protecting
   monuments and sculptures. For example, chemical modification of the
   stone can alter the repulsive forces that stabilize the liquid film
   between the salt and mineral surfaces, thereby reducing the stress that
   the salt can generate. Alternatively, molecules can be introduced into
   the pores of the stone that inhibit the nucleation or growth of salt
   crystals. Many challenges remain, however, particularly in understanding
   the complex interactions between salts, the role of metastable phases,
   the mechanism of crack initiation and growth, and the role of biofilms.}},

   this purpose, a theoretical Lamb wave tuning curve (LWTC) of a specific
   transducer size is generally obtained. Here, the LWTC plots each Lamb
   wave mode' amplitude as a function of the driving frequency. However, a
   discrepancy between experimental and existing theoretical LWTCs has been
   observed due to little consideration of the bonding layer and the energy
   distribution between Lamb wave modes. In this study, calibration
   techniques for theoretical LWTCs are proposed. First, a theoretical LWTC
   is developed when circular PZT transducers are used for both Lamb wave
   excitation and sensing. Then, the LWTC is calibrated by estimating the
   effective PZT size with PZT admittance measurement. Finally, the energy
   distributions among symmetric and antisymmetric modes are taken into
   account for better prediction of the relative amplitudes between Lamb
   wave modes. The effectiveness of the proposed calibration techniques is
   examined through numerical simulations and experimental estimation of
   the LWTC using the circular PZT transducers instrumented on an aluminum
   plate.}},

Abstract = {{Gurson type constitutive models that account for void growth to
   coalescence are not able to describe ductile fracture in simple shear,
   where there is no hydrostatic tension in the material. But recent
   micro-mechanical studies have shown that in shear the voids are
   flattened out to micro-cracks, which rotate and elongate until
   interaction with neighbouring micro-cracks gives coalescence. Thus, the
   failure mechanism is very different from that under tensile loading.
   Also, the Gurson model has recently been extended to describe failure in
   shear, by adding a damage term to the expression for the growth of the
   void volume fraction, and it has been shown that this extended model can
   represent experimental observations. Here, numerical studies are carried
   out to compare predictions of the shear-extended Gurson model with the
   shear failures predicted by the micro-mechanical cell model. Both models
   show a strong dependence on the level of hydrostatic tension. Even
   though the reason for this pressure dependence is different in the two
   models, as the shear-extended Gurson model does not describe voids
   flattening out and the associated failure mechanism by micro-cracks
   interacting with neighbouring micro-cracks, it is shown that the trends
   of the predictions are in good agreement. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The behavior of aluminum/silicon carbide nanolayered composite in
   response to nanoindentation loading is studied. The effects of
   heterogeneity on the deformation fields, as well as the hardness and
   elastic modulus obtained from indentation, are investigated using finite
   element analysis. Attention is also devoted to correlating the numerical
   results with experimental deformation and damage features. The model
   uses an explicit layered structure within the axisymmetric framework. It
   is found that the nanolayered composite results in unique deformation
   patterns. Significant tensile stresses can be generated locally along
   certain directions, which offers a mechanistic rationale for the
   internal cracking observed experimentally. The unloading process also
   leads to an expansion of the tension-stressed area, as well as continued
   plastic flow in parts of the aluminum layers. Comparisons of hardness
   and indentation-derived modulus between modeling and experiments also
   point to the importance of incorporating the detailed geometric features
   when performing indentation analyses. (C) 2009 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{A numerical methodology is proposed in this paper to Simulate the
   degradation of cementitious Materials under external Sulfate attack. The
   methodology includes diffusion of ions in and out of the structure,
   chemical reactions which lead to dissolution and precipitation of
   solids, and mechanical damage accumulation using a continuum damage
   mechanics approach. Diffusion of ions is assumed to occur under a
   concentration gradient as well as under a chemical activity gradient.
   Chemical reactions are assumed to Occur under a local equilibrium
   condition which is considered to be valid for diffusion controlled
   reaction mechanisms. A macro-scale representation of mechanical damage
   is used in this model which reflects the cracking state of the
   Structure. The mechanical and diffusion properties are modified at each
   time step based oil the accumulated damage. The model is calibrated and
   validated using experimental results obtained from the literature. The
   usefulness of the model in evaluating the mineralogical evolution and
   mechanical deterioration of the structure is demonstrated. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Induced anisotropic damage and related permeability variation in brittle
   rocks are investigated. Triaxial compression tests with permeability
   measurement are first performed. It is found that the permeability can
   significantly increase with the growth and coalescence of microcracks.
   The permeability change can be related to the density and opening of
   microcracks. Based on various experimental evidences, a
   micromechanics-based damage model is proposed for the description of
   anisotropic damage. This model takes into account unilateral effects and
   frictional sliding in closed microcracks. The normal opening of
   microcracks generated by the frictional sliding due to the roughness of
   crack surface is also considered. The overall permeability of cracked
   medium isestimated by the volumetric averaging of the local permeability
   in microcracks, which is described by an extended cubic law. Comparisons

Abstract = {{This paper treats evolution of ply cracks in multidirectional composite
   laminates subjected to a quasi-static tensile load in the longitudinal

   A critical laminate energy parameter associated with formation of these
   cracks is defined and is evaluated using experimental data for a
   reference cross-ply laminate. The modeling approach requires crack
   surface displacements, which are calculated by a three-dimensional
   finite element (3-D FE) analysis performed on a suitable representative
   volume of the given cracked laminate. The model predictions agree well
   with experimental data for {[}0/ +/- 0(4)/0(1/2)](s) and {[}0/90/ -/+

   respect to their ability to describe the behaviour of the beams. Linear
   elastic isotropic and orthotropic models were used for the CFRP and a
   perfect bond model and a cohesive bond model was used for the
   concrete-CFRP interface. A plastic damage model was used for the
   concrete. The analyses results show good agreement with the experimental
   data regarding load-displacement response, crack pattern and debonding
   failure mode when the cohesive bond model is used. The perfect bond
   model failed to capture the softening behaviour of the beams. There is
   no significant difference between the elastic isotropic and orthotropic
   models for the CFRP. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) structures and components are highly
   susceptible to damage due to delamination, matrix cracking,
   inter-laminar fracture, and debonding, all of which have potential to
   cause catastrophic structural failure. While numerous sensing
   technologies have been developed and embedded in FRP composites for
   monitoring strain, they serve as defects and can promote damage
   formation and propagation. Thus, in this study, an alternative technique
   is proposed for in situ strain monitoring of FRP composites via
   layer-by-layer multi-walled carbon nanotube-polyelectrolyte thin films
   deposited directly upon glass fiber weaves. To date, these carbon
   nanotube-based thin films have been validated for their
   piezoresistivity. The objective of this study is to characterize the
   strain sensing performance of different thickness thin films deposited
   on glass fiber weaves and embedded in FRP specimens using time-domain
   two-point probe resistance and frequency-domain electrical impedance
   spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. From the experimental thin film
   electromechanical response, a new method for fitting using a cubic
   smoothing spline is implemented and is compared to linear least-squares
   fitting. The results show that the cubic spline fit is better suited for
   capturing the strain sensitivities (or gage factors) of these thin films
   within the time-and frequency-domains along with the variation of strain
   sensitivity with applied strain. The bulk resistance response is
   described by the DC resistance measurements, whereas the EIS
   measurements provide insight of the inter-nanotube response.}},

   profiles on the adjacent layers of the laminate
   In order to reflect the constraints posed by the surrounding plies,
   depending on the ply placement in the laminate (inside/surface),
   different unit cell geometrical models with suitable boundary conditions
   were used for the FE analysis From the numerical simulations It is
   observed that (a) the homogenized elastic constants of the unit cell
   vary considerably depending on the boundary conditions used for the unit

Abstract = {{The calculation of corrosion current density, during the process of
   electrochemical steel corrosion in concrete, requires modelling of the
   following physical and electrochemical processes: transport of capillary
   water, oxygen and chloride through the concrete cover, immobilization of
   chloride in the concrete, transport of OH(-) ions through electrolyte in
   concrete pores and cathodic and anodic polarization. The paper deals
   with a 3D numerical model for transport of capillary water, oxygen and
   chloride through the concrete. The model is formulated in the framework
   of continuum mechanics following basic principles of irreversible
   thermodynamics. The mechanical part of the model is based on the
   hygro-thermo dependent microplane model of concrete. Damage and cracking
   phenomena are modelled within the concept of smeared cracks (weak
   discontinuity). The interaction between the non-mechanical processes
   (distribution of temperature, capillary water, oxygen and chloride) and
   mechanical properties of concrete (damage) is taken into account. The
   strong and weak formulations of the model and the implementation into a
   3D finite element code are discussed. The formulation is restricted to
   the processes leading to depassivation of reinforcement. The application
   of the model is illustrated on a numerical example in which the
   transient 3D finite element analysis of RC slab is carried out to
   investigate the influence of damage of concrete on depassivation time of
   reinforcement. In the analysis, the undamaged and damaged parts of
   previously loaded RC slabs are exposed to the aggressive influence of
   seawater. Due to external load, the RC slab was partly cracked before
   the exposure to seawater. Consequently, the damaged part of the slab
   exhibits a much shorter depassivation time than the undamaged part. This
   is due to the cracking of concrete, which significantly accelerates
   processes that are relevant for depassivation of reinforcement. It is
   shown that depassivation in the cracked concrete is reached almost
   immediately after the attack of chlorides. The numerical results are in
   good agreement with the available experimental observations. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{An approach to estimate interface shear stress of ceramic matrix
   composites during fatigue loading has been developed in this paper. By
   adopting a shear-lag model which includes the matrix shear deformation

   statistical cracking model and fracture mechanics interface debonding
   criterion. Based on the damage mechanisms of fiber sliding relative to

   reloading, the unloading counter slip length and reloading new slip
   length are determined by the fracture mechanics method. The hysteresis
   loops of four different cases have been derived. The hysteresis loss
   energy for the strain energy lost per volume during corresponding cycle
   is formulated in terms of interface shear stress. By comparing the

Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental damage analysis of a 5-harness satin
   weave carbon-PPS (polyphenylene sulphide) composite under uni-axial
   static tensile load In order to understand the local damage behaviour,
   tensile tests were performed and accompanied by acoustic emission (AE)
   and microscopic analysis of the composite specimen. These tests enable
   us to detect the damage initiation stress as well as the damage
   initiation location in the composite Microscopic observation of the
   tested composite laminates allowed the characterization of the sequence
   of intra-yarn transverse damage (perpendicular to the load direction)
   occurrence at different locations in the laminate, starting from crack
   initiation to the final failure of the composite
   The earliest crack events occurred inside the laminate middle layers,
   followed by the damage on the traction free surface It is observed that
   the initiation of the transverse crack, the location of the crack in the
   weft yarn cross-section (centre/near the edges) is affected by the
   relative position of the ply in the laminate (local nesting
   configuration) The first part of this paper deals with the experimental
   characterization of sequential damage in a 5-harness satin weave
   composite. Part II deals with the meso-FE modeling of damage using a
   satin weave unit cell, and the correlation between experimental and

Abstract = {{Previous studies reveal that while compact carbonate rocks display
   exclusively dilatancy under compressive deformation, compaction may be
   observed in their more porous counterparts. In their compactive behavior
   the porous carbonate rocks are more akin to e.g., sandstone. Whereas the
   micromechanics of brittle faulting and cataclastic flow in sandstone has
   been studied extensively, little is known about these processes in a
   porous limestone. To investigate both failure modes we deformed samples
   of Tavel limestone with porosity 10-14\% to various stages of
   deformation in conventional triaxial configuration at confining
   pressures corresponding to brittle faulting and cataclastic flow and
   described the microstructures associated with the damage evolution using
   optical and electron microscopy. In this porous micritic limestone
   cataclasis is the dominant mechanism of deformation. The microcracks
   initiate as pore-emanated and while all pores contribute to microcrack
   initiation, it is the large pores that drive crack propagation and
   coalescence leading to failure. In brittle faulting, dilatancy arises
   from microcracks growing parallel to maximum principal stress, with
   their coalescence leading to shear localization. In cataclastic flow
   microcracks do not have preferred orientation. Interplay between pore
   collapse and formation of new microcracks determines the compactive
   versus dilatant character of the cataclastic flow. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Title = {{Dynamic tensile response of Zr-based bulk amorphous alloys: Fracture
   morphologies and mechanisms}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{107}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Plate impact experiments were conducted to examine the dynamic tensile
   response of Zr-based bulk amorphous alloys (BAAs) having a nominal
   composition of Zr56.7Cu15.3Ni12.5Nb5.0Al10.0Y0.5. The experimental
   configuration used in our work permitted soft recovery of the samples to
   allow a careful examination of the fractured samples along with
   real-time measurements of the sample free-surface velocity (FSV)
   histories. Tensile loading was preceded by elastic compressive loading
   to peak stresses in the 3.6 to 6.0 GPa range. Tensile damage in the
   recovered samples was examined using optical and electron microscopy.
   The microscopy results showed that the BAA samples exhibit a brittle
   behavior (as a glass) at the macroscopic level and a ductile behavior
   (as a metal) at the microscopic level; in addition, corrugations and
   bumps are observed at the nanoscale. The observed fracture morphologies
   are related to three key features present in our spall experiments:
   preceding compressive stress (3.6-6.0 GPa), high tensile loading rate
   (similar to 10(6)/s), high mean tensile stress (similar to 2.3 GPa); and
   are intrinsically related to the amorphous glassy structure of the BAAs
   (free volume content). We propose that the compressive stress depletes
   the free volume content. With increasing compressive stress, the
   available free volume decreases causing a suppression of shear stresses
   during tension. Thus, the mean tensile component becomes more dominant
   at higher stresses. Consequently, the observed surface morphology
   results from brittle cleavage, causing an increased damage localization
   in the recovered samples spalled at higher stresses. These observations
   support the inferences made from measurements of FSV histories. The high
   tensile loading rate is proposed to be responsible for cracking by
   multiple shear band propagation and interception, rendering the observed
   serrated surface morphology. Finally, we proposed that the corrugations
   are created due to a succession of arrest and propagation of mode I
   cracks. A subsequent dilatation, due to the effect of the tensile mean
   stress, caused the corrugations to evolve to bump-type features with
   sizes in the range of 10-100 nm. Our proposed mechanisms, although
   qualitative, constitute a systematic attempt to provide an explanation
   for the fracture morphologies observed in spalled BAA samples. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The effect of crack depth of a rotor-bearing-disk system on vibration
   amplitudes and whirl orbit shapes is investigated through a general
   harmonic balance technique and experimental verification. Two models of
   the crack, which are the breathing and the open crack models, are
   considered. Finite element models and general harmonic balance solutions
   are derived for breathing and open cracks which are valid for damped and
   undamped rotor systems. It is found via waterfall plots of the system
   with a breathing crack that there are large vibration amplitudes at
   critical values of crack depth and rotor speed for a slight unbalance in
   the system. The high vibration amplitudes at the backward whirl appear
   at earlier crack depths than those of the forward whirl for both crack
   models. Resonance peaks at the second, third and fourth subcritical
   speeds emerge as the crack depth increases. It is shown that the unique
   signature of orbits for the breathing crack model which have been
   verified experimentally can be used as an indication of a breathing
   crack in the shaft. In addition, the veering in the critical frequencies
   has been noticed in the open crack case. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Fatigue is one of the most damaging mechanisms in structural components
   With the development of structural nanomatenals, it is imperative to
   investigate the fatigue damage phenomena at the atomic scale To study
   fatigue behavior at the nanoscale, one must apply non-continuum modeling
   frameworks, such as molecular statics (MS). molecular dynamics (MD), and
   Monte Carlo (MC) methods To date, only MD and MS simulations using
   embedded atom method (EAM) and modified embedded atom method (MEAM)
   potentials have been conducted, and this paper reviews these simulations
   of the nanoscale fatigue-crack growth in nickel and copper including
   single crystals, bicrystals, and polycrystals A nanoscale size middle
   tension (MT) specimen with the lateral side applied periodic boundary
   conditions was used to investigate the fatigue behavior in nickel and
   copper single crystals Simulation results revealed that the cyclic
   plastic deformation at the crack tip was the main influencing factor for
   fatigue-crack growth Two main nanoscale mechanisms of crack propagation
   were observed: ( I) the main cracks linked with the voids nucleated in
   front of crack tip due to high dislocation density generated by the
   cyclic loading; and (2) the main cracks broke the atomic bonds in the
   crack plane without much plasticity. For the bicrystals and
   polycrystals, the grain boundaries exerted resistance to the crack
   propagation To study the interactions between cracks and grain
   boundaries, four cases of grain boundary interfaces for copper and two
   cases of grain boundaries for nickel were simulated In copper
   bicrystals, the crack path deviated and moved from one grain to another
   for high misonentations, while there were voids nucleating at gram
   boundaries in front of the crack tip that linked back with the main
   crack Similar to macroscale fatigue, dislocation substructures were
   observed to develop in the atomic lattice during cyclic loading. In
   nickel biaystals, for large misonentations, the cracks were stopped by
   grain boundaries For small `Disorientations, the crack propagated
   through the grain boundary, but the growth rate was reduced due to the
   resistance of the grain boundary. Fatigue-crack growth rates for
   nanocracks were computed and compared with growth rates published in the
   literature for microstructurally small cracks (micron range) and long
   cracks (millimeter range) A nanostructurally small crack (NSC) was
   introduced in terms of the CTOD The quantified NSC growth rates in
   copper single crystals were very similar with those experimentally
   measured for small cracks (micron range) and with those at
   stress-intensity-factor ranges lower than the threshold for long cracks
   (millimeter range). The atomistic simulations indicated that reversible
   plastic slip along the active crystallographic directions at the crack
   tip was responsible for advancing the crack during applied cycling.
   In the case of single or double plastic slip localization at the crack
   tip, a typical Model fatigue crack arose along a slip band and then grew
   into a mixed Mode I + II crack growth mechanism For crystal orientations
   characterized by multiple slip systems concomitantly active at the crack
   tip, the crack advance mechanism was characterized by nanovoid
   nucleation in the high density nucleation region ahead of the crack tip
   and by linkage with the main crack leading to crack extension To
   facilitate observations of fatigue-crack growth, the simulation of a
   copper polycrystal was performed at low temperature 20 K as well The
   crack propagated along persistent slip bands within the grain The crack
   propagatedalong grain boundaries when the angle between the direction of
   crack propagation and the grain boundary was small, while it was impeded
   by the gram boundary when the angle was large The results obtained for
   the crack advance as a function of stress intensity amplitude are
   consistent with experimental studies and a Pans law exponent of
   approximately two (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved}},

Abstract = {{Modern approaches to the modeling of composites are no longer limited to
   the use of a single approach for the whole structure or for all the
   degradation mechanisms. On the contrary, modern advances enable the
   definition of truly multiscale models in order to describe the
   degradation. Thus, homogenized models can be rigorously deduced from the
   underlying micromechanics. In the past few years, LMT-Cachan has made a
   number of contributions to the three key points of these multiscale
   approaches: (1) the improvement of the reference model on the fine
   scale, (2) the definition of a controlled correspondence between the
   scales, and (3) the definition of the associated homogenized model.
   Here, the complete approach is formalized as a modeling pyramid. Each
   mechanism of degradation is described on the more relevant scale within
   an `hybrid micromechanical model'. Based on the reference modeling,
   constitutive laws can be transfered within the unique framework of
   damage mechanics for being applied within commercial softwares. As an
   illustration, we focus more specifically on the homogenized law obtained
   for transverse cracking. The constitutive law and the material
   parameters issued from the homogenization, which define the model on the
   higher scale, are reviewed. Their identification is studied in detail.
   An important key point of the pyramidal approach appears here. Since it
   allows the interpretation of every quantity on different scales (both at
   the micromechanical and at the mesomechanical scales), the most relevant
   scale can be used for the identification of a chosen property. We limit
   ourselves to a `classical' identification. We mean by classical
   identification a procedure based on straight specimens. This process, to
   a certain extent, uses a parametric simulation of the nonlinear model
   based on a finite element representation of the test samples. The
   complete model is then used for the simulation of an industrial sample
   with hole. That example emphasizes the interest of underlying
   micromechanial variables for experimental validation.}},

Abstract = {{Structural reliability analyses of piezoelectric solids need the
   modeling of failure under coupled electromechanical actions. However,
   the numerical simulation of failure due to fracture based on sharp crack
   discontinuities may suffer in situations with complex crack topologies.
   This can be overcome by a diffusive crack modeling based on the
   introduction of a crack phase field. In this work, we develop a
   framework of diffusive fracture in piezoelectric solids. We start our
   investigation with the definition of a crack surface functional of the
   phase field that 1 converges for vanishing length-scale parameter to a
   sharp crack topology. This functional provides the basis for the
   definition of suitable dissipation functions which govern the evolution
   of the crack phase field. Based on experimental results available in the
   literature, we suggest a non-associative dissipative framework where the
   fracture phase field is driven by the mechanical part of the coupled
   electromechanical driving force. This accounts for a hierarchical view
   that considers (i) the decrease of stiffness due to mechanical rupture
   as the primary action that is followed by (ii) the decrease of electric
   permittivity due to the generated free space. The proposed definition of
   mechanical and electrical parts of the fracture driving force follows in
   a natural format from a kinematic assumption, that decomposes the total
   strains and the total electric field into energy-enthalpy-producing
   parts and fracture parts, respectively. Such an approach allows the
   insertion of well-known anisotropic piezoelectric storage functions
   without change. We end up with a three-field-problem that couples the
   displacement with the electric potential and the fracture phase field.
   The latter is governed by a micro-balance equation, which appears in a
   very transparent form in terms of a history field containing a maximum
   fracture source obtained in the time history of the electromechanical
   process. This representation allows the construction of a very robust
   algorithmic treatment based on a operator split scheme, which
   successively updates in a typical time step the history field, the crack
   phase field and finally the two piezoelectric fields. The proposed model
   is considered to be the canonically simple scheme for the simulation of
   diffusive electromechanical crack propagation in solids. We demonstrate
   its modeling capacity by means of representative numerical examples. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper creep crack growth behaviour of P92 welds at 923 K are
   presented. Creep crack growth behaviour for P92 welds are discussed with
   C{*} parameter. Creep crack growth behaviour of P92 welds has been
   compared with that of P91 welds with C{*} parameter. NSW and NSW-MOD
   model were compared with the experimental creep crack growth data. Plane
   strain NSW model significantly overestimates the crack growth rate, and
   plane stress NSW model underestimates it. Whilst, NSW-MOD model for
   plane stress and plane strain conditions gives lower and upper bound of
   the experimental data, respectively.
   FE analysis of creep crack growth has been conducted. Constrain effect
   for welded joints has been examined with C{*} line integrals of C(T)
   specimens. As a result, constant C{*} value using the material data of
   welded joint gives 10 times lower than that of only HAZ property.
   Whilst, the predicted CCG rates for welded joint are 10 times higher
   than those for only HAZ properties. Compared with predicted CCG rate
   from FE analysis and the experimental CCG rate, it can be suggested that
   creep crack growth tests for lower load level or for large specimen
   should be conducted, otherwise the experimental data should give
   unconservative estimation for components operated in long years. (C)

Abstract = {{Samples of concrete at different water-to-cement ratios and air contents
   subjected to freeze/thaw cycles with the lowest temperature at about -80
   degrees C are investigated. By adopting a novel technique, a scanning
   calorimeter is used to obtain data from which the ice contents at
   different freeze temperatures can be calculated. The length change
   caused by temperature and ice content changes during test is measured by
   a separate experiment using the same types of freeze-thaw cycles as in
   the calorimetric tests. In this way it was possible to compare the
   amount of formed ice at different temperatures and the corresponding
   measured length changes. The development of cracks in the material
   structure was indicated by an ultra-sonic technique by measuring on the
   samples before and after the freeze-thaw tests. Further the air void
   structure was investigated using a microscopic technique in which
   air'bubble' size distributions and the so-called spacing factor,
   indicating the mean distance between air bubbles, were measured. By
   analyzing the experimental result, it is concluded that damages occur in
   the temperature range of about -10 degrees C to -55 degrees C, when the
   air content is lower than about 4\% of the total volume. For a totally
   water-saturated concrete, damages always occur independently of the use
   of entrained air or low water-to-cement ratios. It is, further,
   concluded that the length changes of these samples correspond to the
   Calculated ice contents at different temperatures in a linear fashion. @

Abstract = {{On the basis of guided wave propagation in plate-like structures, the
   authors' group previously developed a reference-free crack detection
   technique. The previous technique requires the placement of two pairs of
   collocated lead zirconate titanate (PZT) transducers on the top and
   bottom surfaces of a structure. However, as access to both surfaces can
   be limited for some structural systems, such as aircraft and pipelines,
   an improved reference-free crack detection technique is developed in
   this study to overcome this limitation. The major advancements of the
   proposed reference-free technique over the previous one are (1)
   reformulation of the reference-free technique considering energy
   distribution among Lamb wave modes to overcome the limitations of the
   previous time domain approach, (2) extension to allow the use of various
   input waveforms including broadband chirp signals and narrowband
   toneburst signals, and (3) newly designed PZT transducers for single
   surface installation and better ruggedness. Numerical simulations and
   experimental tests on aluminum plates are performed to investigate the
   performance of the proposed technique. In particular, its robustness to
   varying temperature and external loading is experimentally tested.

Abstract = {{This paper is devoted to experimental investigation of mechanical
   behavior, poroelastic properties and permeability in saturateds and
   stone. The emphasis is to study the evolution of Biot's coefficients and
   permeability with the growth of microcracks. Basic mechanical responses
   are first investigated through triaxial compression tests, showing
   nonlinear stress-strain relations, volumetric dilatancy, pressure
   sensitivity, elastic modulus degradation and induced anisotropy.
   Original tests are then performed for the determination of Biot's
   coefficients in the axial and radial directions at different levels of
   stress. It is shown that the evolution of Biot's coefficient is clearly
   anisotropic in nature due to the oriented closure of initial microcracks
   and growth of induced microcracks. The rock permeability in axial
   direction is also measured for different values of stress; it decreases
   in the first stage with the closure of microcracks and then
   progressively increases due to the opening of induced microcracks.
   However, the permeability significantly increases only when the
   coalescence of microcracks occurs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Degradation of reinforced concrete (RC) structures due to chloride
   penetration followed by reinforcement corrosion has been a serious
   problem in civil engineering for many years. In the present paper, a
   systematic and robust model for predicting service life of RC structures
   is developed which takes environmental humidity and temperature
   fluctuations, chloride binding, diffusion and convection, as well as the
   decay of structural performance into account. The interactions between
   the decay of structural performance, heat and moisture transfer are
   considered in a coupled thermal-hygro-mechanical model. The governing
   equations of heat, moisture and chloride transport into nonsaturated
   concrete are described particularly and solved numerically by finite
   element analysis in space and time domains. Comparisons of numerical
   results with analytical solutions and experimental observations are
   conducted to establish the validity of the proposed numerical model.
   Applications of the numerical model are demonstrated by predicting
   service life of a RC slab exposed to a chloride environment. (c) 2010
