Abstract = {{Mother-of-pearl, also known as nacre, is the iridescent material which
   forms the inner layer of seashells from gastropods and bivalves. It is
   mostly made of microscopic ceramic tablets densely packed and bonded
   together by a thin layer of biopolymer. The hierarchical microstructure
   of this biological material is the result of millions of years of
   evolution, and it is so well organized that its strength and toughness
   are far superior to the ceramic it is made of. In this work the
   structure of nacre is described over several length scales. The tablets
   were found to have wavy surfaces, which were observed and quantified
   using various experimental techniques. Tensile and shear tests performed
   on small samples revealed that nacre can withstand relatively large
   inelastic strains and exhibits strain hardening. In this article we
   argue that the inelastic mechanism responsible for this behavior is
   sliding of the tablets on one another accompanied by transverse
   expansion in the direction perpendicular to the tablet planes. Three
   dimensional representative volume elements, based on the identified
   nacre microstructure and incorporating cohesive elements with a
   constitutive response consistent with the interface material and
   nanoscale features were numerically analyzed. The simulations revealed
   that even in the absence of nanoscale hardening mechanism at the
   interfaces, the microscale waviness of the tablets could generate strain
   hardening, thereby spreading the inelastic deformation and suppressing
   damage localization leading to material instability. The formation of
   large regions of inelastic deformations around cracks and defects in
   nacre are believed to be an important contribution to its toughness. In
   addition, it was shown that the tablet junctions (vertical junctions
   between tablets) strengthen the microstructure but do not contribute to
   the overall material hardening. Statistical variations within the
   microstructure were found to be beneficial to hardening and to the
   overall mechanical stability of nacre. These results provide new
   insights into the microstructural features that make nacre tough and
   damage tolerant. Based on these findings, some design guidelines for
   composites mimicking nacre are proposed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Health monitoring of reinforced concrete bridges and other large-scale
   civil infrastructures has received considerable attention in recent
   years. However, traditional inspection methods (x-ray, C-scan, etc) are
   expensive and sometimes ineffective for large-scale structures.
   Piezoceramic transducers have emerged as new tools for the health
   monitoring of large-scale structures due to their advantages of active
   sensing, low cost, quick response, availability in different shapes, and
   simplicity for implementation. In this research, piezoceramic
   transducers are used for damage detection of a 6.1 m long reinforced
   concrete bridge bent-cap. Piezoceramic transducers are embedded in the
   concrete structure at pre-determined spatial locations prior to casting.
   This research can be considered as a continuation of an earlier work,
   where four piezoceramic transducers were embedded in planar locations
   near one end of the bent-cap. This research involves ten piezoceramic
   patches embedded at spatial locations in four different cross-sections.
   To induce cracks in the bent-cap, the structure is subjected to loads
   from four hydraulic actuators with capacities of 80 and 100 ton. In
   addition to the piezoceramic sensors, strain gages, LVDTs, and
   microscopes are used in the experiment to provide reference data. During
   the experiment, one embedded piezoceramic patch is used as an actuator
   to generate high frequency waves, and the other piezoceramic patches are
   used as sensors to detect the propagating waves. With the increasing
   number and severity of cracks, the magnitude of the sensor output
   decreases. Wavelet packet analysis is used to analyze the recorded
   sensor signals. A damage index is formed on the basis of the wavelet
   packet analysis. The experimental results show that the proposed methods
   of using piezoceramic transducers along with the damage index based on
   wavelet packet analysis are effective in identifying the existence and
   severity of cracks inside the concrete structure. The experimental
   results demonstrate that the proposed method has the ability to predict
   the failure of a concrete structure as verified by results from
   conventional microscopes (MSs) and LVDTs.}},

Abstract = {{A damage plasticity model for ductile fracture is proposed. This model
   is established on the cylindrical coordinate system of principal stress
   space. Experimental results show that fracture initiation in uncracked
   ductile solids is sensitive to the hydrostatic pressure and dependent on

   fracture envelope in principal stress space. Plastic deformation induced
   damage is calculated by an integral of the damage rate measured at
   current loading and deformation status with respect to the fracture
   envelope. A power law damage rule is proposed to characterize the
   nonlinearity in damage accumulation. A damage-related weakening factor
   is adopted to describe the material deterioration. The material
   parameters are calibrated from standard laboratory tests. The proposed
   model is numerically implemented. Four simulations with emphasis on
   crack path prediction are presented. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a technique for the analysis of full wavefield data
   in the wavenumber/frequency domain as an effective tool for damage
   detection, visualization and characterization. Full wavefield data
   contain a wealth of information regarding the space and time variation
   of propagating waves in damaged structural components. Such information
   can be used to evaluate the response spectrum in the
   frequency/wavenumber domain, which effectively separates incident waves
   from reflections caused by discontinuities encountered along the wave
   paths. This allows removing the injected wave from the overall response
   through simple filtering strategies, thus highlighting the presence of
   reflections associated with damage. The concept is first illustrated on
   analytical and numerically simulated data, and then tested on
   experimental results. In the experiments, full wavefield measurements
   are conveniently obtained using a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer,
   which allows the detection of displacements and/or velocities over a
   user-defined grid, and it is able to provide the required spatial and
   time information in a timely manner. Tests performed on a simple
   aluminum plate with artificially seeded slits simulating longitudinal
   cracks, and on a disbonded tongue and groove joint, show the
   effectiveness of the technique and its potentials for the inspection of

Abstract = {{Nacre, also known as mother-of-pearl, is a hard biological composite
   found in the inside layer of many shells such as oyster or abalone. It
   is composed of microscopic ceramic tablets arranged in layers and
   tightly stacked to form a three-dimensional brick wall structure, where
   the mortar is a thin layer of biopolymers (20-30 nm). Although mostly
   made of a brittle ceramic, the structure of nacre is so well designed
   that its toughness is several order of magnitudes larger that the
   ceramic it is made of. How the microstructure of nacre controls its
   mechanical performance has been the focus of numerous studies over the
   past two decades, because such understanding may inspire novel composite
   designs though biomimetics. This paper presents in detail uniaxial
   tension experiment performed on miniature nacre specimens. Large
   inelastic deformations were observed in hydrated condition, which were
   explained by sliding of the tablets on one another and progressive
   locking generated by their microscopic waviness. Fracture experiments
   were also performed, and for the first time the full crack resistance
   curve was established for nacre. A rising resistance curve is an
   indication of the robustness and damage tolerance of that material.
   These measurements are then discussed and correlated with toughening
   extrinsic mechanisms operating at the microscale. Moreover, specific
   features of the microstructure and their relevance to associated
   toughening mechanisms were identified. These features and mechanisms,
   critical to the robustness of the shell, were finely tuned over millions
   of years of evolution. Hence, they are expected to serve as a basis to
   establish guidelines for the design of novel man-made composites.}},

Abstract = {{The equal-channel angular pressing of pure metals is conducted most
   expeditiously by pressing at room temperature using a die with a channel

   difficult-to-work alloys. This paper uses finite element modeling to
   explore the procedures for successfully pressing these more complex
   materials. Separate models are developed using channel angles of 90
   degrees, 110 degrees and 135 degrees for materials having strain rate
   sensitivities of 0, 0.2 and 0.4. The calculations show that cracking and
   segmentation may be reduced or eliminated by increasing the strain rate
   sensitivity and/ or increasing the channel angle within the die. The
   magnitude of the imposed damage is evaluated for each condition using a
   macroscopic damage criterion. It is demonstrated that the predicted

Abstract = {{A plastic-damage constitutive model for plain concrete is developed in
   this work. Anisotropic damage with a plasticity yield criterion and a
   damage criterion are introduced to be able to adequately describe the
   plastic and damage behavior of concrete. Moreover, in order to account
   for different effects under tensile and compressive loadings, two damage
   criteria are used: one for compression and a second for tension such
   that the total stress is decomposed into tensile and compressive
   components. Stiffness recovery caused by crack opening/closing is also
   incorporated. The strain equivalence hypothesis is used in deriving the
   constitutive equations such that the strains in the effective
   (undamaged) and damaged configurations are set equal. This leads to a
   decoupled algorithm for the effective stress computation and the damage
   evolution. It is also shown that the proposed constitutive relations
   comply with the laws of thermodynamics. A detailed numerical algorithm
   is coded using the user subroutine UMAT and then implemented in the
   advanced finite element program ABAQUS. The numerical simulations are
   shown for uniaxial and biaxial tension and compression. The results show
   very good correlation with the experimental data. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{55}},

Abstract = {{Because the uncertainty in current empirical safety factors for
   structural strength is far larger than the relative errors of structural
   analysis, improvements in statistics offer great promise. One
   improvement, proposed here, is that, for quasibrittle structures of
   positive geometry, the understrength factors for structural safety
   cannot be constant but must be increased with structures size. The
   statistics of safety factors has so far been generally regarded as
   independent of mechanics, but further progress requires the cumulative
   distribution function (cdf) to be derived from the mechanics and physics
   of failure. To predict failure loads of extremely low probability (such
   as 10(-6) to 10(-7)) on which structural design must be based, the cdf
   of strength of quasibrittle structures of positive geometry is modelled
   as a chain (or series coupling) of representative volume elements (RVE),
   each of which is statistically represented by a hierarchical model
   consisting of bundles (or parallel couplings) of only two long
   sub-chains, each of them consisting of sub-bundles of two or three long
   sub-sub-chains of sub-sub-bundles, etc., until the nano-scale of atomic
   lattice is reached. Based on Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of thermal
   energies of atoms, the cdf of strength of a nano-scale connection is
   deduced from the stress dependence of the interatomic activation energy
   barriers, and is expressed as a function of absolute temperature T and
   stress-duration c (or loading rate 1/tau). A salient property of this
   cdf is a power-law tail of exponent 1. It is shown how the exponent and
   the length of the power-law tail of cdf of strength is changed by series
   couplings in chains and by parallel couplings in bundles consisting of
   elements with either elastic-brittle or elastic-plastic behaviors,
   bracketing the softening behavior which is more realistic, albeit more
   difficult to analyze. The power-law tail exponent, which is 1 on the
   atomistic scale, is raised by the hierarchical statistical model to an
   exponent of m = 10 to 50, representing the Weibull modulus on the
   structural scale. Its physical meaning is the minimum number of cuts
   needed to separate the hierarchical model into two separate parts, which
   should be equal to the number of dominant cracks needed to break the
   RVE. Thus, the model indicates the Weibull modulus to be governed by the
   packing of inhomogeneities within an RVE. On the RVE scale, the model
   yields a broad core of Gaussian cdf (i.e., error function), onto which a
   short power-law tail of exponent m is grafted at the failure probability
   of about 0.0001-0.01. The model predicts how the grafting point moves to
   higher failure probabilities as structure size increases, and also how
   the grafted cdf depends on T and tau. The model provides a physical
   proof that, on a large enough scale (equivalent to at least 500 RVEs),
   quasibrittle structures must follow Weibull distribution with a zero
   threshold. The experimental histograms with kinks, which have so far
   been believed to require the use of a finite threshold, are shown to be
   fitted much better by the present chain-of-RVEs model. For not too small
   structures, the model is shown to be essentially a discrete equivalent
   of the previously developed nonlocal Weibull theory, and to match the
   Type I size effect law previously obtained from this theory by
   asymptotic matching. The mean stochastic response must agree with the
   cohesive crack model, crack band model and nonlocal damage models.
   The chain-of-RVEs model can be verified and calibrated from the mean
   size effect cure, as well as from the kink locations on experimental
   strength histograms for sufficiently different specimen sizes. (c) 2006

Abstract = {{An experimental method to determine the complete stress versus
   deformation relation for a thin adhesive layer loaded in shear is
   presented. The method is based on a classic specimen geometry; the
   end-notch flexure specimen. The experiments are evaluated using an
   inverse method. First, the variation of the energy release rate with
   respect to the shear deformation at the crack tip is measured during an
   experiment. Then the traction-deformation relation is derived using an
   inverse method. The theory is based on the path-independence of the
   J-integral and considers the effects of a flexible adhesive layer.
   Quasi-static experiments on three different specimen geometries are
   performed using a servo-hydraulic testing machine. The experiments give
   consistent results. This shows that the traction-deformation relation
   can be taken as independent of the dimensions of the adherends. Thus,
   the constitutive relation can be considered as a property of the
   adhesive layer. The deformation process at the crack tip is also
   monitored during the experiments by the use of a digital camera attached
   to a microscope. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A new methodology of guided-wave-based nondestructive testing (NDT) is
   developed to detect crack damage in a thin metal structure without using
   prior baseline data or a predetermined decision boundary. In
   conventional guided-wave-based techniques, damage is often identified by
   comparing the `current' data obtained from a potentially damaged
   condition of a structure with the `past' baseline data collected at the
   pristine condition of the structure. However, it has been reported that
   this type of pattern comparison with the baseline data can lead to
   increased false alarms due to its susceptibility to varying operational
   and environmental conditions of the structure. To develop a more robust
   damage diagnosis technique, a new concept of NDT is conceived so that
   cracks can be detected even when the system being monitored is subjected
   to changing operational and environmental conditions. The proposed NDT
   technique utilizes the polarization characteristics of the piezoelectric
   wafers attached on both sides of the thin metal structure. Crack
   formation creates Lamb wave mode conversion due to a sudden change in
   the thickness of the structure. Then, the proposed technique instantly
   detects the appearance of the crack by extracting this mode conversion
   from the measured Lamb waves, and the threshold value from damage
   classification is also obtained only from the current dataset. Numerical
   and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the applicability
   of the proposed technique to instantaneous crack detection.}},

Abstract = {{The micromechanics of ductile fracture has made enormous progress in
   recent years. This approach, which was mostly developed in the context
   of structural integrity analysis, is becoming a key tool for materials
   scientists to optimize materials fracture properties and forming
   operations. Micromechanical models allow quantitatively linking fracture
   properties, microstructure features at multiple lengths scales, and
   manufacturing conditions. After briefly reviewing the state of the art,
   this paper illustrates the application of the micromechanics-based
   methodology by presenting the results of an investigation on the damage
   resistance of 6xxx Al produced by extrusion.
   The presence of coarse, elongated, particles is the key microstructural
   feature affecting the fracture behaviour of 6xxx Al. The detrimental
   elongated beta-type particles are transformed into rounded alpha-type
   particles by heat treatment. In situ tensile tests revealed that, at
   ambient temperature, the alpha particles and the beta particles oriented
   with the long axis perpendicular to the main loading direction undergo
   interface decohesion, while the beta particles oriented perpendicular to
   the loading direction break into several fragments. At high
   temperatures, only interface decohesion is observed. Uniaxial tensile
   tests on notched and smooth round bars were performed on two different
   alloys, at different temperatures ranging between 20 degrees C and 600
   degrees C, under different loading rates, while systematically varying
   the content in beta versus alpha particles. The ductility increases with
   decreasing amount of P beta particles, increasing temperature and strain
   rates, and decreasing stress triaxiality.
   A viscoplastic extension of the Gurson model has been developed for
   capturing the complex hierarchy of damage mechanisms, coupled with
   viscoplastic and stress state effects. Three populations of voids are
   modelled while accounting for the different void nucleation mechanisms
   leading to different initial void aspect ratio. Proper modelling of the
   initial void aspect ratio and of its evolution with void growth was the
   key to predict the effect of the beta -> alpha conversion on ductility.
   The void coalescence criterion takes into account the presence of
   secondary voids resulting from particle fragmentation. The
   characteristics of particles entering the model were all measured
   experimentally. The temperature and rate dependent flow properties of
   the matrix material have been obtained by inverse modelling. The only
   fitting parameters are the critical stresses for void nucleation. The
   model is validated by comparing the predictions to the experimental data
   involving different relative proportion of alpha and beta particles,
   temperature, loading rate and stress triaxiality. This type of model
   opens the path for an ``alloy by design{''} strategy which relates
   end-use properties to upstream manufacturing operations. (C) 2006

Abstract = {{A new processing method was developed for spreading fiber tows to make
   thin-ply laminated composites. The present method with a constant
   airflow through sagged fiber filaments can efficiently spread the thick
   tows without damaging any fibers. This method is robust and easy
   compared with other available thin-ply methods. The thin plies of
   thickness less than one-third of the conventional plies can easily be
   made with the tow-spreading technology.
   Experiments were performed to evaluate the performance of tow-spread,
   thin-ply laminated composites. To study the thickness effect of the
   laminated composites, the test specimens were made with the same
   material and the same spread tows, but with dispersed and, grouped
   laminations of the plies. Uniaxial tension static and fatigue loadings
   were applied on both unnotched and open-hole specimens. Impact and
   compression-after-impact tests were also conducted. From stress-strain
   curves, acoustic emission counts, X-ray photos, c-scan images and
   observation of damage modes of failed specimens, it was observed that
   the thin-ply laminated composites can suppress the microcracking,
   delamination and splitting damage for static, fatigue and impact
   loadings without special resin and/or 3-D reinforcements. Therefore, the
   laminate design can be simplified by using higher strain allowable
   without a progressive failure analysis. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to investigate damage-temperature-stress
   level-permeability interactions in structural concrete. The tests are
   performed on hollow cylindrical concrete specimens, subjected to
   compressive loading and temperature up to 150 degrees C. The results
   emphasize that at stress levels lower than 80\% of the peak stress, the
   variation of permeability is small and it is slightly influenced by the
   stress. As a matter of fact, the permeability under load is smaller than
   the permeability measured after unloading. As the load exceeds 80\% of
   the peak stress, micro-cracking increases rapidly, causing an increase
   of the permeability and a greater sensitivity to the applied load, i.e.
   a noticeable difference between the permeability measured under load and
   after unloading, the first becoming greater than the latter. In the
   post-peak phase the increase of permeability is much larger due to
   significant crack width growth. The increase of permeability with the
   applied load seems to be greater with temperature, inducing further
   alterations of concrete and dilation of the porous structure of the
   material. Finally, the experimental results seem to agree with the
   formal of coupled evolution of the permeability due to damage and
   temperature assumed by Gawin et al. {[}D. Gawin, C.E. Majorana, B.A.

Abstract = {{The built-in stress test (BIST) is extensively used for diagnostics or
   identification of failure. The current version of BIST approach is
   focused on reactive failure detection and provides limited insight into
   reliability and residual life. A new approach has been developed to
   monitor product-level damage during shock and vibration. The approach
   focuses is on the pre-failure space and methodologies for quantification
   of failure in electronic equipment subjected to shock and vibration
   loads using the dynamic response of the electronic equipment. Presented
   methodologies are applicable at the system-level for identification of
   impending failures to trigger repair or replacement significantly prior
   to failure. Leading indicators of shock-damage have been developed to
   correlate With the damage initiation and progression in shock and drop
   of electronic assemblies.
   Three methodologies have been investigated for feature extraction and
   health monitoring including development of a new solder-interconnect
   built-in reliability test, FFT based statistical-pattern recognition,
   and time-frequency moments based statistical pattern recognition. The
   solder-joint built-in reliability-test has been developed for detecting
   high-resistance and intermittent faults in operational, fully programmed
   field programmable gate arrays. Frequency band energy is computed using
   FFT and utilized as the classification feature to check for damage and
   failure in the assembly. In addition, the Time Frequency Analysis has
   been used to study of the energy densities of the signal in both time
   and frequency domain, and provide information about the time-evolution
   of frequency content of transient-strain signal. Closed-form models have
   been developed for the eigen-frequencies and mode-shapes of electronic
   assemblies with various boundary conditions and component placement
   configurations. Model predictions have been validated with experimental
   data from modal analysis. Pristine,configurations have been perturbed to
   quantify the degradation in confidence values with progression of
   damage. Sensitivity of leading indicators of shock-damage to subtle
   :changes in boundary conditions, effective flexural rigidity, and
   transient strain response have been quantified. Explicit Finite element
   models have been developed and various kinds :)of failure modes have
   been simulated such as solder ball cracking, package falloff and solder
   ball failure. This allows he physical quantification of solder ball
   crack damage in the form of confidence values and provides a damage
   index that can be utilized for the health monitoring of solder
   interconnects in an electronic assembly.}},

Abstract = {{The Fatemi-Socie criterion, the Jiang criterion, and a short crack
   growth based criterion were evaluated using the combined axial-torsion
   fatigue testing results obtained from extensive experiments on
   thin-walled tubular specimens made from S460N. The Fatemi-Socie
   criterion combines the maximum shear strain amplitude with a
   consideration of the normal stress on the critical plane. The Jiang
   criterion makes use of the plastic strain energy on a material plane as
   the major contributor to the fatigue damage. By assuming an initial
   crack length, the short crack model attributes the fatigue life to the
   action of a crack driving force, namely the effective cyclic J-integral.
   The results show that all the three criteria correlated well with the
   experimental observations in terms of fatigue life predictions. A great
   discrepancy was found between the predicted cracking directions and the
   observed cracking orientations. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Permeability of macro-cracked argillite under confinement: Gas and water
   testing}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{8-14}},
Pages = {{667-680}},
Abstract = {{Argillite is considered a privileged candidate for long term nuclear
   waste storage. Yet argillite rock drilling often induces surface cracks
   that locally modify its permeability. This phenomenon located in a
   so-called Excavation Damaged Zone (EDZ) is of importance since
   permeability increase means lesser confinement capacity of the argillite
   rock. Potentially influencial phenomena occur when argillite is
   subjected simultaneously to normal stress variations and fluid seepage.
   Therefore, this extensive experimental study (6 month duration) on
   macro-cracked Callovo-Oxfordian argillite is aimed at distinguishing the
   contribution to rock permeability of mechanical loading (crack opening
   and closing) on one part and of chemically active fluid seepage (water)
   on the other. Steady state gas flow tests show the permeability K mainly
   depends upon crack closure cc, with values on the order of 10(-14) m(2).
   Permeability from transient water flow tests varies with test duration
   from 10(-18) to 10(-21) m(2). In both test types, K also depends upon
   confining pressure P-c, mainly during the first three loading-unloading
   phases. A difference between water injection tests and gas injection
   tests is that the water-saturated rock sample swells. Swelling does not
   contribute to unload the crack zone but rather creates additional
   closure and pressure in the crack area. Indeed, water permeability is
   shown to depend upon cumulated crack closure a(c), which sums up
   swelling and confinement-induced crack closure. Finally, this study
   outlines the strong effect of water upon crack closure amplitude and
   permeability. After a relatively short time (on the order of ten days),
   water flow within the crack drives the permeability back to very low
   values close to sound rock permeability (10(-21) m(2)). This reflects a
   complete self-sealing of the macro-crack, which is an important factor
   for nuclear waste repository safety. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{There are significant changes in the vibration responses of cracked
   structures when the crack depth is significant in comparison to the
   depth of the structure. This fact enables the identification of cracks
   in structures from their vibration response data. However when the crack
   is relatively small, it is difficult to identify the presence of the
   crack by a mere observation of the vibration response data. A new
   approach for crack detection in beam-like structures is presented and
   applied to cracked simply supported beams in this paper. The approach is
   based on finding the difference between two sets of detail coefficients
   obtained by the use of the stationary wavelet transform (SWT) of two
   sets of mode shape data of the beam-like structure. These two sets of
   mode shape data, which constitute two new signal series, are obtained
   and reconstructed from the modal displacement data of a cracked simply
   supported beam. They represent the left half and the modified right half
   of the modal data of the simply supported beam. SWT is a redundant
   transform that doubles the number of input samples at each iteration. It
   provides a more accurate estimate of the variances at each scale and
   facilitates the identification of salient features in a signal,
   especially for recognising noise or signal rupture. It is well known
   that the mode shape of a beam containing a small crack is apparently a
   single smooth curve like that of an uncracked beam. However, the mode
   shape of the cracked beam actually exhibits a local peak or
   discontinuity in the region of damage. Therefore, the mode shape
   `signal' of a cracked beam can be approximately considered as that of
   the uncracked beam contaminated by `noise', which consists of response
   noise and the additional response due to the crack. Thus, the modal data
   can be decomposed by SWT into a smooth curve, called the approximation
   coefficient, and a detail coefficient. The difference of the detail
   coefficients of the two new signal series includes crack information
   that is useful for damage detection. The modal responses of the damaged
   simply supported beams used are computed using the finite element
   method. For real cases, mode shape data are affected by experimental
   noise. Therefore, mode shape data with a normally distributed random
   noise are also studied. The results show that the proposed method has
   great potential in crack detection of beam-like structures as it does
   not require the modal parameters of an uncracked beam as a baseline for
   crack detection. The effects of crack size, depth and location, and the
   effects of sampling interval are examined. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In vitro experiments and an elastic wave model were used to analyze how
   stress is induced in kidney stones by lithotripsy and to test the roles
   of individual mechanisms-spallation, squeezing, and cavitation.
   Cylindrical U30 cement stones were treated in an HM-3-style
   lithotripter. Baffles were used to block specific waves responsible for
   spallation or squeezing. Stones with and without surface cracks added to
   simulate cavitation damage were tested in glycerol (a cavitation
   suppressive medium). Each case was simulated using the elasticity
   equations for an isotropic medium. The calculated location of maximum
   stress compared well with the experimental observations of where stones
   fractured in two pieces. Higher calculated maximum tensile stress
   correlated with fewer shock waves required for fracture. The highest
   calculated tensile stresses resulted from shear waves initiated at the
   proximal corners and strengthened along the side surfaces of the stone
   by the liquid-borne lithotripter shock wave. Peak tensile stress was in
   the distal end of the stone where fracture occurred. Reflection of the
   longitudinal wave from the distal face of the stone-spallation-produced
   lower stresses. Surface cracks accelerated fragmentation when created
   near the location where the maximum stress was predicted. (c) 2007

Abstract = {{Amongst a large number of fatigue criteria proposed for the prediction
   of crack initiation in thermo-mechanical fatigue, various approaches
   have been found to be particularly useful for certain categories of
   material over specific domains of temperature and cyclic strain.
   However, no particular approach appears to give invariably better
   predictions than others, so that the choice of the lifing model must be
   based on validation for the relevant circumstances.
   In this paper, the focus is placed on the energy dissipation criterion
   (EDC). We present physical arguments in favour of this approach's
   versatility, and illustrate its performance by the application of this
   approach both in the macroscopic and micromechanical context.
   Firstly, by way of illustration we consider cyclic deformation of a
   Ramberg-Osgood material, with a view to establish the equivalence
   between the EDC and some selected classical criteria. For this simple
   but analytically tractable case several interesting results can be
   established, including the equivalence between EDC and both stress range
   and strain range lifing criteria.
   Secondly, we consider fatigue loading of polycrystalline FCC material
   deforming by the combination of anisotropic linear elasticity and
   crystal slip. Energy dissipation density in this case is
   location-dependent even for a polycrystal subjected to macroscopically
   uniform stress and strain. Crack initiation then is predicted to occur
   at the `weakest link' location corresponding to the most intense
   dissipation.
   The above two versions of energy dissipation criteria are each compared
   against experimental data. The comparative performance of Walker strain,
   Smith-Watson-Topper (SWT) and EDC lifing methods is assessed. It is
   concluded that EDC provides improved reliability, particularly for cases
   of complex loading paths and mechanisms interactions. (C) 2007 Elsevier

Volume = {{90}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to explore the relationships between the extension of
   rock desaturation and the Excavation Damaged Zone (EDZ) subsequent to
   the excavation of a century-old tunnel and of recent drifts (1996 and
   2003) at the Tournemire Underground Research Laboratory (URL) located in
   the Aveyron county (South of the Massif Central, France). The other
   objective of this work was to assess the impact of desaturation on the
   hydraulic head profile measured around the tunnel. One section was
   selected per drift. Two boreholes were drilled for each section: one
   parallel and one inclined (45 degrees) with respect to the bedding. For
   each borehole, we performed on-site drill core mapping, petrophysical
   measurements, pneumatic and hydraulic tests by means of a Modular
   Mini-Packer System (MMPS). Results indicate that the EDZ around drifts
   is mainly a combination of unloading joints, mimicking the drift shape,
   and of desaturation cracks, parallel to the bedding. The EDZ extension
   around the tunnel is twice to three times that of the drifts of 1996 and
   2003 and is essentially composed of unloading joints resulting from the
   mechanical response of the rock. The masonery covering the tunnel walls
   is assumed to have protected the rock from seasonal variations of air
   humidity, thus limiting (without excluding) the formation of
   desaturation cracks. The EDZ extension deduced from core mapping is in
   agreement with that deduced from pneumatic tests with permeabilities
   several orders of magnitude greater than in the undisturbed zone.
   Degrees of saturation for the three sections range between 0.9 and 1 in
   the EDZ area and reach 1 in the undamaged zone. The head profile deduced
   from measurements recorded since 2002 indicates the occurrence of an
   Excavation disturbed Zone (EdZ) of about 40 m around the tunnel. This
   EdZ is Rely due to the existence of sub-atmospheric water pressures
   clearly seen in the first meter around the tunnel. We have tried to
   quantify the impact of the tunnel since its excavation on saturation
   degree and on hydraulic heads. The simulation was performed by
   considering, as a first approach, the absence of fracturing in the EDZ.
   A constant suction of - 33 00 m, deduced from the mean annual values of
   relative humidity and temperature measured in the tunnel atmosphere
   since 2002, was applied at the tunnel wall. The degrees of saturation
   simulated around the tunnel are underestimated in the EDZ area and
   consistent to experimental data in the unfractured zone. The modelling
   of hydraulic heads is overestimated in the horizontal direction and is
   in the domain of experimental values in the vertical direction, but the
   lack of intermediate data cannot enable us to conclude on this
   consistency. This study demonstrated the role played by fracturing on
   the distribution of petrophysical parameters and of heads around drifts
   and the century-old tunnel. It has also demonstrated the necessity of
   coupling mechanic and hydraulic calculations by considering capillary
   forces. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rghts reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A phenomenological anisotropic damage progression formulation for porous
   ductile metals with second phases is described through mechanisms of
   void nucleation, growth and coalescence. The model is motivated from
   fracture mechanisms and microscale physical observations. To describe
   the creation of new pores, the decohesion at the particle-matrix
   interface and the fragmentation of second phase particles, the
   void-crack nucleation equation is related to several microstructural
   parameters (fracture toughness, length scale parameter, particle size,
   volume and fraction of second phase), the plastic strain level, and the
   stress state; Nucleation is represented by a general symmetric second
   rank tensor, and its components are proportional to the absolute value
   of the plastic strain rate components. Based on the Rice and Tracey
   model, void growth is a scalar function of the trace of damage tensor
   and the positive triaxiality. Like nucleation, coalescence is a second
   rank tensor governed by the plastic strain rate tensor and the stress
   state. The coalescence threshold is related to the void length scale for
   void impingement and void sheet mechanisms. The coupling of damage with
   the Bammann-Chiesa-Johnson (BCJ) plasticity model is written in the
   thermodynamic framework and derives from the concept of effective stress
   assuming the hypothesis of energy equivalence. A full-implicit algorithm
   is used for the stress integration and the determination of the
   consistent tangent operator. Finally, macroscale correlations to cast
   A356 AL alloy and wrought 6061-T6 AL alloy experimental data are
   completed with predictive void-crack evolution to illustrate the
   applicability of the anisotropic damage model. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The past developments on tow-placement technology led to the production
   of machines capable of controlling fibre tows individually and placing
   them onto the surface of a laminate with curvilinear topology. Due to
   the variation of properties along their surface, such structures are
   termed variable-stiffness composite panels.
   In previous experimental research tow-steered panels have shown
   increased buckling load capacity as compared with traditional
   straight-fibre laminates. Also, numerical analyses by the authors showed
   that first-ply failure occurs at a significant higher load level. The
   focus of this paper is to extend those analyses into the postbuckling
   progressive damage behaviour and final structural failure due to
   accumulation of fibre and matrix damage. A user-developed continuum
   damage model implemented in the finite element code ABAQUS (R) is
   employed in the simulation of damage initiation and material stiffness
   degradation.
   In order to correctly predict the buckling loads of tow-steered panels
   under compression, it is of crucial importance to take into account the
   residual thermal stresses resulting from the curing process. Final
   failure of tow-steered panels in postbuckling is predicted to within
   10\%, difference of the experimental results. Curvilinear-fibre panels
   have up to 56\% higher strength than straight-fibre laminates and damage
   initiation is also remarkably postponed. Tow-steered designs also show
   more tolerance to central holes than traditional laminates. (c) 2007

Abstract = {{A combined analytical and experimental study is conducted to develop
   efficient and effective damage detection techniques for beam-type
   structures. Unlike many other vibration-based damage detection methods,
   in which the mode shapes are often chosen to retrieve damage
   information, the uniform load surface (ULS) is employed in this study
   due to its less sensitivity to ambient noise. In combination with the
   ULS, two new damage detection algorithms, i.e., the generalized fractal
   dimension (GFD) and simplified gapped-smoothing (SGS) methods, are
   proposed. The GFD method is developed by modifying the conventional
   definition of fractal dimension. By using a moving window, the GFD of
   ULS can be obtained for each sampling point, and due to the irregularity
   of ULS introduced by the damage, a peak exists on the GFD curve
   indicating the location of the damage. Not only does such a peak at the
   GFD curve locate the damage, but also it reveals the relative size of
   the damage. The SGS method is also proposed to take advantage of the
   simple deformation shape of ULS. Both methods are then applied to the
   ULS of cracked and delaminated beams obtained analytically, from which
   the damage location and size are determined successfully. Based on the
   experimentally measured curvature mode shapes, both the GFD and SGS
   methods are further applied to detect three different types of damage in
   carbon/epoxy composite beams. The successful detection of damage in the
   composite beams demonstrates that the new techniques developed in this
   study can be used efficiently and effectively in damage identification
   and health monitoring of beam-type structures.}},

Abstract = {{A series of 20 chevron cracked notched Brazilian disc (CCNBD) samples of
   Westerly granite were failed in a standard Mode I tensile test at room
   temperature in order to evaluate the effect of thermal damage on
   fracture toughness. The heat treatment involved slowly heating four sets
   of four samples to 250, 450, 650 and 850 degrees C. The fifth set of
   samples was not thermally treated. Thermal cracking not only induced a
   substantial decrease of the mechanical strength, but also of the dynamic
   elastic properties of Westerly granite. In particular, normalized P-wave
   compressional velocities matched remarkably well the decreasing trend of
   normalized fracture toughness (K(1C)). Above 450 degrees C, grain
   boundary opening and cracking, intragranular cracking and mineral grain
   dissection linked to the quartz alpha-beta phase transition induced a
   significant increase in the total crack density. Fracture path
   interaction with various mineral-mineral contact types showed that
   fracture branching and total fracture length increased with the amount
   of temperature of heat treatment.
   Using non-interactive crack theories, dimensionless crack densities were
   obtained from wave velocity inversion, up to unusually high values of
   similar to 10 at 850 degrees C. This geophysical analysis showed to be
   in close agreement with crack parameters determined optically, such as
   optical crack density determination, crack aspect ratio evolutions, and
   the measured sample porosity with temperature. Our results also show
   that only the non-interactive crack theory can predict K(1C) relatively
   well at high crack density, by simply using dimensionless crack
   densities inverted from velocities. A decrease of 50\%, for crack
   densities larger than 1, 80\% for crack densities larger than 5 is
   predicted, in close agreement with Our observed experimental variation
   of K(1C). At the microscale, this can be interpreted by the fact that
   the main fracture is strongly interacting with the pre-existing
   microcrack fabric. These combined experimental and modeling results
   illustrate the importance of understanding the details of how the rock
   microstructure is changing in response to an external stimulus, ill
   order to predict the simultaneous evolution of physical and mechanical
   properties of rock. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   brittle material can be taken into account, with special attention to
   the numerical analysis of an excavation damaged zone (EDZ) around an
   opening, which is a major concern in assessing the safety of underground
   repositories. The present model is capable of reproducing the three
   characteristic stages of creep behavior (i.e., primary, secondary, and
   tertiary creep) commonly observed in the laboratory creep tests. The
   sub-critical microcrack growth parameters (i.e., n and A) can be
   determined for Inada granite by fitting the numerical results of elapse
   time to failure versus the creep stress ratio curve with the
   experimental data under both dry and wet conditions. lt is found that
   moisture has a significant influence on the parameter A rather than the
   parameter n. Use of the extended model makes it possible to analyze not
   only the extension of microcrack length, but also the development of EDZ
   around an opening as a function of time. The damaged zones mainly
   develop in the sidewalls of the opening in the case that the vertical
   stress sigma(22) is larger than the horizontal stress sigma(11). (C)

Abstract = {{Non-steady state deformation and annealing experiments on vein quartz
   are designed to simulate earthquake-driven episodic deformation in the
   middle crust. Three types of experiments were carried out using a
   modified Griggs-type solid medium deformation apparatus. All three start
   with high stress deformation at a temperature of 400 degrees C and a
   constant strain rate of 10(-4) S-1 (type A), some are followed by
   annealing in the stability field of alpha-quartz for 14-15 h at zero
   nominal differential stress and temperatures of 800-1000 degrees C (type
   A+B), or by annealing for 15 h at 900 degrees C and at a residual stress
   (type A+C).
   The quartz samples reveal a very high strength > 2 GPa at a few percent
   of permanent strain. The microstructures after short-term high stress
   deformation (type A) record localized brittle and plastic deformation.
   Statisc annealing (type A+B) results in recrystallisation restricted to
   the highly damaged zones. The new grains aligned in strings and without
   crystallographic preferred orientation, indicate nucleation and growth.
   Annealing at non-hydrostatic conditions (type A+C) results in shear
   zones that also develop from deformation bands or cracks that formed
   during the preceding high stress deformation. In this case, however, the
   recrystallised zone is several grain diameters wide, the grains are
   elongate, and a marked crystallographic preferred orientation indicates
   flow by dislocation creep with dynamic recrystallisation. Quartz
   microstructures identical to those produced in type A+B experiments are
   observed in cores recovered from Long Valley Exploratory Well in the
   Quaternary Long Valley Caldera, California, with considerable seismic
   activity.
   The experiments demonstrate the behaviour of quartz at coseismic loading
   (type A) and subsequent static annealing (type A+B) or creep at decaying
   stress (type A+C) in the middle crust. The experimentally produced
   microfabrics allow to identify similar processes and conditions in
   exhumed rocks. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   potential proposed here help to better describe the rock behaviour in

   the induced cracks is also considered in a simple way. Due to its
   physical nature, different from classical soils, the partially saturated
   behaviour of this rock could not be correctly described by any of the
   pre-existing theories usually used for the partially saturated porous
   media (soils). Based upon experimental results on this rock and
   developing some ideas proposed by other authors, an extension of the
   saturated elastic-plastic model in unsaturated field is proposed. The
   key hypothesis of this extension is the evolution of the Biot's

Abstract = {{The published literature relating to damage to planar solid oxide fuel

   reviewed. This covers reported studies of thermal cycling performance
   and stresses induced by temperature gradients and differences in thermal
   expansion coefficients in typical planar SOFC configurations, namely
   electrolyte supported; anode supported and inert substrate supported
   cells. Generally good agreement is found between electrolyte residual
   stresses measured by X-ray diffraction or cell curvature and stresses
   calculated from simple thermo-elastic analysis. Finite element modelling
   of temperature distributions in cells and stacks in steady state
   operation are well advanced and capable of being extended to compute
   stress distributions. Failure criteria are then discussed for laminated
   cell structures based on critical energy release rate fracture mechanics
   models developed originally for coatings. However, in most cases the
   data required to apply the models quantitatively (such as elastic moduli
   of actual laminated material and fracture energies of materials and
   interfaces) are not available. Where data are available there are
   inconsistencies that require resolution. Seals are critical components
   in many planar solid oxide fuel cell configurations, but again there are
   discrepancies in experimental mechanical properties and the role of

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a numerical simulation of interlaminar damage
   propagation in FRP laminates under transverse loading, using the finite
   element method. First, we conducted drop-weight impact tests on CFRP
   cross-ply laminates. A ply crack was generated at the center of the
   lowermost ply, and then a butterfly-shaped interlaminar delamination was
   propagated at the 90/0 ply interface. Based on these experimental
   observations, we present a numerical simulation of interlaminar damage
   propagation, using a cohesive zone model to address the energy-based
   criterion for damage propagation. This simulation can address the
   interlaminar delamination with high accuracy by locating a fine mesh
   near the damage process zone, while maintaining computational efficiency
   with the use of automatic mesh generation. The simulated results of
   interlaminar delamination agreed well with the experiment results.
   Moreover, we demonstrated that the proposed method reduces the
   computational cost of the simulation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{One possible loosening mechanism of the femoral component in total hip
   replacement is fatigue cracking of the cement mantle. A computational
   method capable of simulating this process may therefore be a useful tool
   in the preclinical evaluation of prospective implants. In this study, we
   investigated the ability of a computational method to predict fatigue
   cracking in experimental models of the implanted femur construct.
   Experimental specimens were fabricated such that cement mantle
   visualisation was possible throughout the test. Two different implant
   surface finishes were considered: grit blasted and polished. Loading was
   applied to represent level gait for two million cycles. Computational
   (finite element) models were generated to the same geometry as the
   experimental specimens, with residual stress and porosity simulated in
   the cement mantle. Cement fatigue and creep were modelled over a
   simulated two million cycles. For the polished stem surface finish, the
   predicted fracture locations in the finite element models closely
   matched those on the experimental specimens, and the recorded stem
   displacements were also comparable. For the grit blasted stem surface
   finish, no cement mantle fractures were predicted by the computational
   method, which was again in agreement with the experimental results. It
   was concluded that the computational method was capable of predicting
   cement mantle fracture and subsequent stem displacement for the
   structure considered. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A robust iterative algorithm is used to identify the locations and
   extent of damage in beams using only the changes in their first several
   natural frequencies. The algorithm, which combines a first-order
   multiple-parameter perturbation method and the generalized inverse
   method, is tested extensively through experimental and numerical means
   on cantilever beams with different damage scenarios. If the damage is
   located at a position within 0-35\% or 50-95\% of the length of the beam
   from the cantilevered end, while the resulting system equations are
   severely underdetermined, the minimum norm solution from the generalized
   inverse method can lead to a solution that closely represents the
   desired solution at the end of iterations when the stiffness parameters
   of the undamaged structure are used as the initial stiffness parameters.
   If the damage is located at a position within 35-50\% of the length of
   the beam from the cantilevered end, the resulting solution by using the
   stiffness parameters of the undamaged structure as the initial stiffness
   parameters deviates significantly from the desired solution. In this
   case, a new method is developed to enrich the measurement information by
   modifying the structure in a controlled manner and using the first
   several measured natural frequencies of the modified structure. A new
   method using singular value decomposition is also developed to handle
   the ill-conditioned system equations that occur in the experimental
   investigation by using the measured natural frequencies of the modified
   structure.}},

Journal = {{CORROSION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{2781-2799}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The main purpose of this work is to analyze the degradation mechanisms
   induced on industrial HVOF cermet coatings by tribocorrosion.
   Tribocorrosion of cermet coatings is a subject that has not been widely
   analyzed in research studies: in fact, while many works dealing with
   wear or corrosion of HVOF cermet coatings are published, studies
   relevant to the combined processes (wear and corrosion) are relatively
   few.
   The tribocorrosion mechanisms of the cermet coatings were studied in a
   sodium chloride solution under sliding wear, trying to combine and
   integrate differently produced mechanical and electrochemical damage
   phenomena.
   Electrochemical techniques such as potentiodynamic polarization curves
   as well as potentiostatic (I vs t) or galvanostatic (E vs t) methods
   were used in order to stimulate and to interprete tribocorrosion
   degradation mechanisms.
   It was shown that coating post grinding, which is a mechanical operation
   usually performed after the deposition of conventional cermet coatings
   in order to obtain a desired roughness, could produce structural
   damages, which can greatly affect the mechano-chemical behaviour of the
   cermet coatings. Mainly abrasive-adhesive wear mechanisms were observed
   on the coating surface and sometimes, depending on coatings mechanical
   properties (fracture toughness), cracks developed during wear causing
   the coating continuity breaking. In the latter case, the degradation
   mechanism is no longer governed only by surface tribocorrosion, but
   undermining corrosion can occur, greatly affecting sample performances
   and promoting coating detachment.
   Cr3C2-NiCr coatings, under all the selected experimental conditions,
   showed good barrier properties and substrate corrosion was never
   observed. Moreover, when chromium was added to the
   metal matrix of WC-Co based systems, tribocorrosion behaviour was
   enhanced and the lower tribocorrosion rates were measured.
   Finally, it was shown that electrochemical techniques can be used to
   govern the coating corrosion processes and to interpret the main
   degradation mechanisms, even though they seem not to provide a precise
   quantitative analysis of tribocorrosion. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This article deals with the prediction of debonding between core and
   face sheet in foam-cored sandwich structures. It describes the
   development, validation, and application of a FEM-based numerical model
   for the prediction of the propagation of debond damage. The structural
   mechanics is considered to be geometrically nonlinear while the local
   fracture mechanics problem is assumed to be linear. The presented
   numerical procedure for the local fracture mechanics is a further
   development of the crack surface displacement method, here denoted as
   the crack surface displacement extrapolation method. The considered
   application example is to tear off one of the face laminates from the
   sandwich. This configuration can be found in many applications but is
   considered here to be occurring in a ship structure, particularly at the
   hard spot where the superstructure meets the deck. Face tearing
   experiments are carried out for structures with three different core
   densities, material tests are carried out and finally the face tearing
   tests are simulated with the developed procedure. It is shown that for
   low core densities, where the crack propagates in the interface
   immediately below the face sheet, there is fair agreement between
   experiments and theory. For cores with higher density, the crack tends
   to propagate in the laminate itself with extensive fiber bridging
   leading to rather conservative numerical predictions. However, for
   structural configurations where LEFM can be applied, the presented
   procedure is sufficiently robust and accurate to be used in a number of
   important engineering applications, for example risk-based inspection
   and repair schemes.}},

Abstract = {{The safety and operability of road networks is, in part, dependent on
   the quality of the pavement. It is known that pavements suffer from many
   different structural problems which can lead to damage to the pavement
   surface. To minimize the effect of these problems programmed policies
   for pavement management are required. Additionally a given local anomaly
   on the road surface can affect the safety of the road to various degrees
   according to the category of the road, so it is possible to set up
   different programmes of repair according to the different standards of
   road.
   Programmed policies for pavement management are required because of the
   wide structural damage which occurs to pavements during their normal
   operating life. This has consequences for the safety and operability of
   road networks. During the last decade, road networks suffered from great
   structural damage. The damage occurs for different reasons, such as the
   increasing traffic or the lack of means for routine maintenance. Many
   forms of damage, originating in the bottom layers are invisible until
   the pavement cracks. They depend on the infiltration of water and the
   presence of cohesive soil greatly reduces the bearing capacity of the
   subasphalt layers and underlying soils. On the basis of an in-depth
   literature review, an experimental survey with Ground Penetrating Radar
   (GPR) was carried out to calibrate the geophysical parameters and to
   validate the reliability of an indirect diagnostic method of pavement
   damage. The experiments were set on a pavement under which water was
   injected over a period of several hours. GPR travel time data were used
   to estimate the dielectric constant and the water content in the unbound
   aggregate layer, the variations in water content with time and
   particular areas where rate of infiltration decreases. A new methodology
   has been proposed to extract the hydraulic permittivity fields in
   sub-asphalt structural layers and soils from the moisture maps observed
   with GPR. It is effective at diagnosing the presence of clay or cohesive
   soil that compromises the bearing capacity of sub-base and induces
   damage. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper summarises an attempt to propose a methodology suitable for
   estimating high-cycle fatigue strength of cylindrical contacts under a
   partial slip regime. In particular, Taylor's point method, usually
   applied to predict fatigue limits of notched components, was used in
   conjunction with the Modified Wohler Curve Method allowing us to
   formulate a novel fretting fatigue prediction methodology. The devised
   procedure takes as its starting point the idea that to correctly
   estimate fatigue damage under fretting fatigue two different aspects
   must be taken into account: stress gradients and degree of multiaxiality
   of the stress field damaging the fatigue process zone. The first problem
   was addressed by using the Theory of Critical Distances, whereas the
   latter by using an appropriate multiaxial fatigue criterion. In order to
   check the accuracy of the proposed methodology, a number of tests on
   cylindrical contacts were selected from the technical literature for two
   high strength alloys commonly used in the aerospace industry, namely
   Al4\%Cu and Ti-6Al-4V. The performed analyses showed a sound agreement
   between estimations and experimental data. In particular, the proposed
   method correctly predicted failures in the medium-cycle fatigue regime,
   allowing the high-cycle fatigue estimations to fall within an error
   interval of about +/- 20\%. This result is very interesting, especially
   by the light of the fact that such an approach is based on the use of
   linear-elastic stresses, making it suitable for being used in situations
   of practical interest by post-processing linear-elastic finite element
   results. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},
