Abstract = {{The first part of this two-part study presents a new improved microplane
   constitutive model for concrete, representing the fourth Version in the
   Line of microplane models developed at Northwestern University. The
   constitutive law is characterized as a relation between the normal,
   volumetric, deviatoric, and shear stresses and strains on planes of
   various orientations, called the microplanes. The strain components on
   the microplanes are the projections of the continuum strain tensor, and
   the continuum stresses are obtained from the microplane stress
   components according to the principle of virtual work. The improvements
   include (I) a work-conjugate volumetric deviatoric split-the main
   improvement, facilitating physical interpretation of stress components;
   (2) additional horizontal boundaries (yield limits) for the normal and
   deviatoric microplane stress components, making it possible to control
   the curvature at the peaks of stress-strain curves; (3) an improved
   nonlinear frictional yield surface with plasticity asymptote; (4) a
   simpler and more effective fitting procedure with sequential
   identification of material parameters; (5) a method to control the
   steepness and tail length of postpeak softening: and (6) damage modeling
   with a reduction of unloading stiffness and crack-closing boundary. The
   second part of this study, by Caner and Bazant, will present an
   algorithm for implementing the model in structural analysis programs and
   provide experimental verification and calibration by test data.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with gear condition monitoring based on vibration
   analysis techniques. The detection and diagnostic capability of some of
   the most effective techniques are discussed and compared on the basis of
   experimental results, concerning a gear pair affected by a fatigue
   crack. Tn particular, the results of new approaches based on
   time-frequency and cyclostationarity analysis are compared against those
   obtained by means of the well-accepted cepstrum analysis and
   time-synchronous average analysis. Moreover, the sensitivity to fault
   severity is assessed by considering two different depths of the crack.
   The effect of transducer location and processing options are also shown.
   In the case of the experimental results considered in this paper, the
   power cepstrum is practically insensitive to the crack evolution.
   Conversely, the spectral correlation density function is able to monitor
   the fault development and dos not seem to be significantly influenced by
   the transducer position. Analysis techniques of the time-synchronous
   average, such as this `residual' signal and the demodulation technique,
   are able to localise the damaged tooth; however, the sensitivity of the
   demodulation technique is strongly dependent on the proper choice of the
   filtering band and affected by the transducer location. The wavelet
   transform seems to be a good tool for crack detection: it is
   particularly effective if the residual part of the time-synchronous
   averaged signal is processed. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Marbles as building stones as well as in their natural environments show
   complex weathering phenomena. The most important damage scenario is
   based on the highly anisotropic thermal expansion coefficient cu of
   calcite, i.e. extreme expansion parallel and contraction normal to the
   crystallographic c-axis. Therefore, the rock fabric and especially the
   lattice-preferred orientation (texture) of calcite and/or dolomite as
   the predominant mineral phases in marbles have a significant influence
   on the mechanical weathering. The textures of marbles from five
   different locations vary from a more or less perfect prolate to moderate
   oblate shape of the {[}006] pole figure tensor. Accordingly, the
   texture-derived bulk thermal dilatation anisotropy covers a broad range
   from -0.048 to 0.680. The modelled thermal dilatations correlate with
   those obtained from experimental measurements. The difference in
   magnitude is basically explained by the microcrack fabrics which was not
   considered in the computations. All samples show a deterioration due to
   thermal treatment regardless of the strength of texture. The directional
   dependence of (a) the total magnitude of the thermal dilatation
   coefficient and (b) of the residual strain is highest in marbles with a
   strong texture, whereas the Carrara marble with a weak texture exhibits
   a uniform crack formation. The progressive loss of cohesion along grain
   boundaries due to dilatancy may serve as an example for the initial
   stage of physical weathering.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of traversing cracks on the steady-state diffusion
   properties of concrete was studied. The effect of both anisotropic and
   isotropic crack networks was first theoretically assessed using an
   analytical approach. To simplify the transport equations, cracks were
   assumed to be of uniform size and evenly distributed on a one- or
   two-dimensional grid. Results of the theoretical analysis were then
   compared to experimental data. Both series of results indicate that
   cracking can markedly alter the diffusion properties of the material and
   favor the penetration (or the leaching) of drifting species. A simple
   method to predict the effect of cracking on the concrete diffusivity is
   proposed. Predictions are made on the basis of two parameters: the crack
   density and the mean crack aperture. This method can provide a first
   estimate of the diffusion properties of severely damaged concrete

   measurement of resonant frequencies and damping ratios as function of

Abstract = {{Damage detection in vibrating beams, or beam systems, is dealt with in
   this paper. Damage is represented by a more or less concentrated
   decrease in stiffness. A linear behavior is assumed before and after the
   damage. A peculiar aspect of damage detection, at times neglected, is
   that damage is frequently concentrated in a few zones, albeit unknown,
   so that only the modification in the characteristics of a few sections
   or elements needs to be determined. Attention is focused on the basic
   aspects of the problem, by discussing the amount of frequencies
   necessary to locate and quantify the damage uniquely. Two different
   procedures of damage identification are used, which mainly take
   advantage of the peculiar characteristics of the problem. Cases with
   pseudoexperimental and experimental frequencies are solved. A
   generalization of the procedure based on finite-element models, which
   makes possible the tackling complex structural cases, is illustrated and

Abstract = {{This study presents the results of an experimental investigation

   Impact tests were conducted to characterize the type and extent of the
   damage observed in a variety of sandwich configurations with
   graphite/epoxy face sheets and foam or honeycomb cores. Correlation of
   the residual indentation and cross-sectional views of the impacted
   specimens provide a criterion for the extent of the damage. In the
   foam-core samples, significant damage was found to be present for
   residual indentations over 0.13 mm. Although the high-density foam-core
   and thicker face sheet increased the amount of energy required to
   generate damage, the damage was still similar for similar levels of
   residual indentation. For the honeycomb samples, 0.25 nun of residual
   indentation indicated significant levels of internal damage. However,
   the surfaces of both the honeycomb and foam samples revealed very little
   damage at these levels of impact energy. As the impact energy was
   increased, the samples experienced one of two types of damage: a tear or
   crack from the center of the laminate to the edge, or significant damage

Abstract = {{Both fretting wear and fretting fatigue suffer from particle detachment
   and cracking induced damage. Wear induced by fretting is related to a
   three-stage phenomenon: (1) accommodation of the displacement in the
   upper layers of the two counterbodies; (2) detachment of particles from
   material with a modified or transformed structure; and (3) third-body
   behaviour, i.e. accommodation of the velocity in the powder bed.
   The specific transformed structure from which debris is made is called
   the tribologically transformed structure or TTS. TTS has been shown to
   form in the first accommodation stage within a very few initial fretting
   cycles. Understanding of its formation and degradation are required to
   control and predict wear generated by fretting. Extensive studies
   focussed on the nature of TTSs depending on several metallic contacts
   (steels, aluminium alloys, alpha-, beta-, or alpha + beta -titanium
   alloys,...) and different testing conditions (load, sliding amplitude,
   number of cycles, environment). Powerful analytical tools were utilized
   to determine the TTS composition and structure. TTS appeared as a
   nanocrystalline structure, corresponding to the chemical composition of
   the initial material and made of the more stable structure in accordance
   with the equilibrium diagram. No specific effects of oxygen or hydrogen
   was detected. In the present article, experimental results will be
   discussed to point out possible mechanisms of the formation of the TTS.
   An analogy with butterflies which form under rolling fatigue will be
   outlined. At last, an energy approach to explain formation will be
   presented for the case of low-alloy steel. It is demonstrated that TTS
   formation is related to a critical cumulative plastic deformation
   associated with a specific threshold dissipated energy. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{This paper describes the localization of deformation acceleration in the

   stabilize the failure process by controlling axial stress to maintain a
   constant rate of AE (for monitoring AE hypocenters) as in previous works

   multichannel data collection system. This enables us to elucidate the
   dynamics of fault nucleation under condition of constant stress (creep)
   loading, which is a better approximation to low strain rate condition in
   the Earth and allows both quasi-static and dynamic crack growth to
   occur. The waveforms of more than 8000 AE events which occurred mainly
   during a 15 s period were recorded on 32 channels, with a sampling rate
   of 50 ns and mask time of 200 mu s. Hypocentral locations of AE sources
   revealed that the fault initiated at one end of the core and then
   propagated into the unfaulted rock with a process zone (fault front) of
   intense cracking. We found that there were two different processes
   operating during the quasi-static nucleation of a shear fault, namely a
   process zone in front of the fault tip and a ``wake{''} of damage zone
   following the process zone. The process zone had the following features:
   (1) major tensile cracking, (2) low b value and fewer larger events, and
   (3) strong self-excitation. The mechanism of crack interaction and fault
   growth was, therefore, a mutual enhancement` on dilatation due to
   tensile cracking, On the other hand, the damage zone was characterized
   by (1) major shear cracking, (2) low b value and more larger events, and
   (3) weak self-excitation, indicating that in the damage zone, following
   the development of a shear fault, linkage between cracks became the
   major mechanism of crack interaction and fault development. The mutual
   changes of b value and self-exciting strength observed in our
   experiments seem to occur as a result of the hierarchy of fault growth,
   which was not observed under slowed down loading conditions. Therefore
   our experimental results, under a realistic approximation of the dynamic
   condition of the Earth, are meaningful for the problems of earthquakes
   as well as rock bursts.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the feasibility of using cohesive theories of fracture,
   in conjunction with the direct simulation of fracture and fragmentation,
   in order to describe processes of tensile damage and compressive
   crushing in concrete specimens subjected to dynamic loading. We account
   explicitly for microcracking, the development of macroscopic cracks and
   inertia, and the effective dynamic behaviour of the material is
   predicted as an outcome of the calculations. The cohesive properties of
   the material are assumed to be rate-independent and are therefore
   determined by static properties such as the static tensile strength. The
   ability of model to predict the dynamic behaviour of concrete may be
   traced to the fact that cohesive theories endow the material with an
   intrinsic time scale. The particular configuration contemplated in this
   study is the Brazilian cylinder test performed in a Hopkinson bar. Our
   simulations capture closely the experimentally observed rate sensitivity
   of the dynamic strength of concrete in the form of a nearly linear
   increase in dynamic strength with strain rate. More generally, our
   simulations give accurate transmitted loads over a range of strain
   rates, which attests to the fidelity of the model where rate effects are
   concerned. The model also predicts key features of the fracture pattern
   such as the primary lens-shaped cracks parallel to the load plane, as
   well as the secondary profuse cracking near the supports. The primary
   cracks are predicted to be nucleated at the centre of the circular bases
   of the cylinder and to subsequently propagate towards the interior, in
   accordance with experimental observations. The primary and secondary
   cracks are responsible for two peaks in the load history, also in
   keeping with experiment. The results of the simulations also exhibit a
   size effect. These results validate the theory as it bears on mixed-mode
   fracture and fragmentation processes in concrete over a range of strain
   rates. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the results of a research activity concerning the

   crack approach is devised for the computer simulation of the (TPB) three
   point bending tests: the best matching is achieved for a rectangular
   Dugdale-type cohesive law. Though not proposing novel experimental or

   describes the utilisation of ductile fracture criteria in conjunction

   predicting and quantifying fracture initiation sites is investigated.
   Ring, cylindrical, tapered and flanged upset test samples are utilised
   for providing the experimental values of the critical damage at fracture
   under several different loading conditions.
   Two of the ductile fracture criteria are then utilised to predict the
   initiation site and the level of deformation at which surface or
   internal cracking will occur during finite element simulation of three
   types of metalworking processes, namely, radial extrusion, open-die
   forging and blanking. The analysis is made in conjunction with metal

Abstract = {{The finite element method is used to study the effects of particle
   cluster morphology on the fracture and debonding of silicon particles
   embedded in an Al-1\%Si matrix subjected to tensile-compressive cyclic
   loading conditions. Representative of an actual cast A-Si alloy,
   clusters of silicon inclusions (4-8 particles) are considered rather
   than a single isolated inclusion or an infinite periodic array of
   inclusions. The silicon particles are modeled with a linear-elastic
   constitutive relationship and the matrix material is modeled using an
   internal state variable cyclic plasticity model fitted to experimental
   data on matrix material. A total of seven parameters are varied to
   create 16 idealized microstructures: relative particle size, shape,
   spacing, configuration, alignment, grouping and matrix microporosity. A
   two-level design of experiment (DOE) methodology is used to screen the
   relative importance of the seven parameters on the fracture and
   debonding of the silicon particles. The results of the study demonstrate
   that particle shape and alignment are undoubtedly the most dominant
   parameters influencing initial particle fracture and debonding. Particle
   debonding results in a local intensification of stresses in the Al-1\%Si
   matrix that is significantly larger than that due to particle fracture.
   The local stress fields after particle fracture are primarily
   concentrated within the broken particle halves. After the fracture of
   several particles within a cluster, the spacing between adjacent
   particles enters as a second-order effect. When several particles within
   a cluster debond, the spacing between adjacent particles enters as a
   dominant effect due to the large local stress intensification in the
   surrounding Al-1\%Si matrix. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The effects of fiber surface treatment on ultimate tensile strength
   (UTS) of unidirectional (UD) epoxy resin matrix composites are examined
   experimentally. The interfacial shear strength (IFSS) and statistical
   fiber strength are significantly altered by five different kinds of
   surface treatments, which are: (a) unsized and untreated; (b)
   gamma-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (gamma-GPS); (c)
   gamma-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (gamma-MPS); (d) mixture of
   gamma-aminoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (gamma-APS), film former (urethane)
   and lubricant (paraffin); and (e) urethane-sized. The maximum UTS is
   obtained for the relatively strong interfacial adhesion
   (glass/gamma-MPS/epoxy) but not for the strongest interfacial adhesion
   (glass/gamma-GPS/epoxy). The governing micro-damage mode around a broken
   fiber and the interface region is matrix cracking for gamma-GPS treated
   fibers, and a combination of interfacial debonding and matrix cracking
   for gamma-MPS treated fibers. The microdamage mode related to the
   interfacial adhesion strongly affects the fracture process, and thus the
   UTS of UD composites. The results also indicate that the interfacial
   adhesion can be optimized for effective utilization of fiber strength
   for fiber composites. A parameter called ``efficiency ratio{''} of fiber
   strength in UD composites is proposed to examine and distinguish
   different effects of IFSS and fiber strength on the UTS of UD
   composites. The experimental results show that improved UTS of UD
   composites due to surface treatments mainly result from the increase in
   fiber strength but not from the modified interface. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{It has been established in previouspapers that stress wave attenuation
   measurements performed on concrete are very sensitiveto thepresence of
   damage located along the wave path. In this paper, a modified form of
   this concept is introduced in a self-compensating measurement scheme:
   surface wave transmission is obtained across a range of frequencies,
   between two sensing points on the surface of a concrete specimen. The
   obtained signal transmission values are independent of the type of wave
   transmitter and receiver used. An experimental test series on a range of
   concrete slabs containing notches and controlled cracks of varying
   depths is described. The cracks are generated by subjecting the slabs to
   flexure using a closed-loop loading-procedure. The actual depth of each
   generated crack is determined with the laser-based phase measurement
   interferometry technique. Self-compensating wave transmission
   measurements are performed across the discontinuities (notches, open
   cracks, and closed cracks) and are shown to be repeatable and sensitive
   to the presence of notches, and even tightly-closed cracks. A
   relationship between the wave transmission and the crack depth
   normalized with respect to propagating wavelength is noted. This
   relationship appears to be largely unaffected by the type of concrete
   and the nature of the discontinuity. The results demonstrate that
   self-compensating wave transmission measurements show excellent
   potential for sensitive detection and sizing of surface-breaking cracks
   in concrete structures.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this research was to determine the shear strength of a
   unidirectional carbon-fibre/epoxy composite by means of the 10 degrees
   off-axis and 0 degrees Iosipescu specimens subjected to shear. Detailed
   non-linear finite-element computations of these two tests were
   conducted, taking into account the actual non-linear material behavior
   of the composite. The tests were compared in terms of stresses and
   strains at failure. It was found that the shear strength of the
   composite can be very accurately determined by using the two independent
   testing techniques only if fully non-linear finite element computations
   of the tests are performed. The stresses and strains at failure in the
   10 degrees off-axis specimen closely match. the, stresses and strains at
   the onset of intralaminar damage near the roots of the notches in
   Iosipescu specimens. Owing to the difficulties associated with the
   measurement of the shear strength of the composite using the Iosipescu
   test, and in particular, with the interpretation of the experimental
   data, this test was found to be almost impractical for the determination
   of shear strength. The test can only be used if fully non-linear finite
   element computations of uncracked and axially cracked Iosipescu
   specimens are conducted in conjunction with the continuous monitoring of
   intralaminar damage near the roots of the notches during testing. In
   addition, the shear strength results obtained from the Iosipescu
   specimen should be independently verified by using another method, such
   as the 10 degrees off-axis test. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

   under partial slip situations. Validated for classical fatigue
   conditions, the Dang Van's fatigue prediction is compared to fretting
   cracking mechanisms. The correlation is achieved according to some
   conditions :
   - The friction coefficient operating in the annular partial slip contact
   has to be identified.
   It permits more accurate estimation of the stress loading path.
   - The loading states which are computed to determine the crack
   nucleation risk must be averaged on an elementary volume representative
   of the microstructure of the steel. It allows a convenient size effect
   consideration regarding the very small material volume stressed below

Title = {{Fracture mechanics of ASR in concretes with waste glass particles of

Volume = {{126}},

Abstract = {{Using waste glass as an aggregate in concrete can cause severe damage
   because of the alkali-silica reaction (ASR) between the alkali in the
   cement paste and the silica in the glass. Recent accelerated 2-week
   tests, conducted according to ASTM C 1260, revealed that the damage to
   concrete caused by expansion of the ASR gel, which is manifested by
   strength reduction, depends in these tests strongly on the size of the
   glass particles. As the particle size decreases, the tensile strength
   first also decreases, which is expected because of the surface-to-volume
   ratio of the particles, and thus their chemical reactivity increases.
   However, there exists a certain worst (pessimum) size below which any
   further decrease of particle size improves the strength, and the damage
   becomes virtually nonexistent if the particles are small enough. The
   volume dilatation due to ASR is maximum for the pessimum particle size
   and decreases with a further decrease of size. These experimental
   findings seem contrary to intuition. This paper proposes a
   micromechanical fracture theory that explains the reversal of particle
   size effect in the accelerated 2-week test by two opposing mechanisms:
   (1) The extent of chemical reaction as a function of surface area, which
   causes the strength to decrease with a decreasing particle size; and (2)
   the size effect of the cracks produced by expansion of the ASR gel,
   which causes the opposite. The pessimum size, which is about 1.5 mm,
   corresponds to the case where the effects of both mechanisms are
   balanced. For smaller sizes the second mechanism prevails, and for sizes
   <0.15 mm no adverse effects are detectable. Extrapolation of the
   accelerated test (ASTM C 1260) to real structures and full lifetimes
   will require coupling the present model with the modeling of the
   reaction kinetics and diffusion processes involved.}},

Abstract = {{In the aircraft industry the use of externally bonded composite repairs
   has become an accepted way of repairing fatigue, or corrosion, damaged
   metallic structural components. However, current NDI and damage
   assessment techniques for composite repairs are passive and generally
   performed on ground. The challenge is to develop new techniques
   utilising recent analytical and experimental tools. This report examines
   the use of optical fibre sensors. Optical fibres offer a means of
   monitoring the load transfer process in these repairs, and can therefore
   be used to provide an indication of the integrity of the repair. This
   paper describes the use of an array of fibre Bragg grating strain
   sensors (FBGs) for the: in situ monitoring of bonded repairs to aircraft
   structures and, in particular, the monitoring of crack propagation
   beneath a repair. In this work the FBGs have been multiplexed using a
   combination of wavelength and spatial techniques employing a tunable
   Fabry-Perot (FP) filter to track individual gratings. The multiplexed
   FBGs were then surface-mounted on a boron-epoxy unidirectional composite
   patch bonded to an aluminium component. The sensors were located so as
   to monitor the changing stress field associated with the propagation of
   a crack beneath the patch. The ability of relating experimental results
   to sensor readings is then confirmed using both a thermo-elastic scan of
   the patch and 3D finite element analysis. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The nonlinear vibro-acoustic response of solid samples containing quite
   a small amount of defects can be anomalously high in magnitude compared
   to the case of undamaged intact solids. Functional dependencies of the
   nonlinear effects exhibit rather interesting behavior. In this paper,
   experimental results on nonlinearity-induced cross-modulation of a
   high-frequency (HF) f = 15 - 30 kHz signal by a low-frequency (LF) F =
   20 - 60 Hz vibration in an aluminum plate with a small single crack are
   reported. Comparison with a reference sample (the identical plate
   without a crack) has proven that the presence of such a small defect can
   be easily detected due to its nonlinear manifestations. It is
   demonstrated that under proper choice of the sounding signal parameters,
   the effect level can be so pronounced that the amplitude of the
   modulation side-lobes originated due to the nonlinearity exceeds the
   amplitude of the fundamental harmonic of the HF signal. Main functional
   features of the observed phenomena are analyzed,and a new physical
   explanation is suggested based on a dissipative mechanism of

Abstract = {{The presented experimental results for 2xxx, 6xxx and 7xxx type
   aluminium alloys show a variability of the fatigue crack growth rates in
   the Paris regime to an extent important for the materials selection
   according to the damage tolerant design concept in the aircraft
   industry. This paper briefly reviews the controversial views on the
   correlation between coefficient and exponent in the power law equation
   of fatigue crack growth. A new approach to the correlation based on a
   scaling factor of the stress intensity factor range is outlined. It is
   shown that the correlation is an algebraic one that can be suppressed by
   choosing a particular scaling factor characteristic of the set of
   materials under investigation. The approach allows the variability of
   the power law coefficient to be quantified more clearly and the
   responsible influence factors to be identified. (C) 2000 Published by

Title = {{Statistical analysis of the progression of transverse cracking and

Abstract = {{The paper presents a statistical analysis of the transverse cracking and
   delamination process induced in cross-ply laminates subjected to tensile
   loading. First, the paper considers the initiation and progression of
   transverse cracking. This progression is evaluated by an iterative
   procedure combining a generalized model for evaluating the stress field
   in a cracked laminate with a statistical distribution of strengths in
   the 90 degrees layer. Comparisons between the results obtained by this
   procedure and the experimental results of the literature show that for
   very low crack densities the progression of transverse cracking is
   governed by a strength distribution associated with weakness areas
   resulting from the presence of particular defects in laminates. Next,
   for higher crack densities the strength distribution in the 90 degrees
   layer can be described by a pseudo-normal distribution associated with
   the other defects. Finally, the paper considers the development of
   delamination which is initiated from the crack tips in the case of some
   laminates. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The possibility of decreasing ultimate tensile strength associated with
   increasing fiber/matrix interfacial sliding is investigated in
   ceramic-matrix composites. An axisymmetric finite-element model is used
   to calculate axial fiber stresses versus radial position within the
   slipping region around an impinging matrix crack as a function of
   applied stress and interfacial sliding stress tau. The stress fields,
   showing an enhancement at the fiber surface, are then utilized as an
   effective applied field acting on annular flaws at the fiber surface,
   and a made I stress intensity is calculated as a function of applied
   stress, interface tau and flaw size. The total probability of failure
   due to a pre-existing spectrum of flaws in the fibers is then determined
   and utilized within the Global Load Sharing model to predict fiber
   damage evolution and ultimate failure. For small fiber Weibull moduli (m
   approximate to4), the local stress enhancements are insufficient to
   preferentially drive failure near the matrix crack. Hence, the composite
   tensile strength is weakly affected and follows the shear-lag model
   predictions, which show a monotonically increasing strength with
   increasing tau. For larger Weibull moduli (m approximate to 20), the
   composite is found to weaken beyond about tau = 50 MPa and exhibit
   reduced fiber pullout, both leading to an apparent embrittlement and
   showing substantial differences compared with the shear-lag model.
   Literature experimental data on an SiC fiber/glass matrix system are
   compared with the predictions. (C) 2000 Acta Metallurgica Inc. Published
