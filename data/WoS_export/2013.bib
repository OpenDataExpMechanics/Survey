Abstract = {{Rock fracture under upper crustal conditions is driven not only by
   applied stresses, but also by time-dependent, chemically activated
   subcritical cracking processes. These subcritical processes are of great
   importance for the understanding of the mechanical behaviour of rocks
   over geological timescales. A macroscopic manifestation of
   time-dependency in the brittle field is the observation that rocks can
   deform and fail at constant applied stresses, a phenomenon known as
   brittle creep. Here, we review the available experimental evidence for
   brittle creep in crustal rocks, and the various models developed to
   explain the observations. Laboratory experiments have shown that brittle
   creep occurs in all major rock types, and that creep strain rates are
   extremely sensitive to the environmental conditions: differential
   stress, confining pressure, temperature and pore fluid composition. Even
   small changes in any of these parameters produce order of magnitude
   changes in creep strain rates (and times-to-failure). Three main classes
   of brittle creep model have been proposed to explain these observations:
   phenomenological, statistical, and micromechanical. Statistical and
   micromechanical models explain qualitatively how the increasing
   influence of microcrack interactions and/or the increasing accumulated
   damage produces the observed evolution of macroscopic deformation during
   brittle creep. However, no current model can predict quantitatively all
   of the observed features of brittle creep. Experimental data are limited
   by the timescale over which experiments are realistically feasible.
   Clearly, an extension of the range of available laboratory data to lower
   strain rates, and the development of new modelling approaches are needed
   to further improve our current understanding of time-dependent brittle
   deformation in rocks. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The fatigue life of a component can be expressed as the sum of two
   segments of life: (a) the number of loading cycles required to initiate
   a crack and (b) the number of cycles it takes that crack to propagate to
   failure. In this review, the primary emphasis is relating the fatigue
   crack initiation to the microstructure of the material. Many studies
   have focused on this phenomenon over the years and the goal of this
   paper is to put this work in perspective and encourage future work of
   fatigue in polycrystals based on the material's microstructure. In order
   to address fatigue, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms that
   facilitate crack initiation. Slip irreversibilities exist in a material
   and accumulate during fatigue loading. At the defect level,
   irreversibilities are a result of dislocations: annihilating,
   cross-slipping, penetrating precipitates, transmitting through grain
   boundaries, and piling-up. These slip irreversibilities are the early
   signs of damage during cyclic loading. The dislocations subsequently
   form low-energy, stable structures as a means to accommodate the
   irreversible slip processes and increasing dislocation density during
   cyclic forward and reverse loading. The result is strain localizing in a
   small region within the materials, i.e. persistent slip bands and
   dislocation cells/bundles. Strain localization is a precursor to crack
   initiation. This review paper will focus on experimental observations of
   strain localization and the theory and numerical analysis of both slip
   irreversibilities and low energy configuration defect structures. This
   fundamental understanding is necessary to study persistent slip bands in
   FCC metals and alloys including the appropriate characterization,
   theory, and modeling. From this fundamental knowledge both
   micromechanical and crystal plasticity models can be used to predict
   crack initiation, which are also reviewed. Finally, this review ends
   with a discussion of the future of fatigue modeling and experiments. (C)

Title = {{Lattice modeling of chloride diffusion in sound and cracked concrete}},
Journal = {{CEMENT \& CONCRETE COMPOSITES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{42}},
Pages = {{30-40}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Reinforced concrete structures are frequently exposed to aggressive
   environmental conditions. Most notably, chloride ions from sea water or
   de-icing salts are potentially harmful since they promote corrosion of
   steel reinforcement. Concrete cover of sufficient quality and depth can
   ensure protection of the steel reinforcement. However, it is necessary
   to study the effects of material heterogeneity and cracking on chloride
   ingress in concrete. This is done herein by proposing a
   three-dimensional lattice model capable of simulating chloride transport
   in saturated sound and cracked concrete. Means of computationally
   determining transport properties of individual phases in heterogeneous
   concrete (aggregate, mortar, and interface), knowing the concrete
   composition and its averaged transport properties, are presented and
   discussed. Based on numerical experimentation and available literature,
   a relation between the effective diffusion coefficient of cracked
   lattice elements and the crack width was adopted. The proposed model is
   coupled with a lattice fracture model to enable simulation of chloride
   ingress in cracked concrete. The model was validated. on data from the
   literature, showing good agreement with experimental results. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The authors have recently completed two world-wide failure exercises,
   which dealt with benchmarking recognised failure criteria under
   two-dimensional and three-dimensional loadings, respectively. A new
   phase, called the third world-wide failure exercise' is currently
   underway to fill some of the major gaps identified in the previous
   activities. The third world-wide failure exercise is concerned with
   highlighting the degree of maturity of the current capabilities of 12
   internationally recognised methods for modelling various aspects of
   damage in composite materials. Such problems include matrix cracks due
   to thermal and mechanical loads; delamination; ply constraint and
   stacking sequence effects; loading and unloading phenomena; failure due
   to stress gradients (in particular the hole size effect). The topics
   addressed within the third world-wide failure exercise represent an
   extremely important and crucial area for advanced modelling and virtual
   testing of composites. The third world-wide failure exercise runs in two
   stages (1) Part A which is devoted to providing full details and a
   comparison between the 12 theories together with their blind'
   predictions, made by their originators, for a challenging set of test
   problems and (2) Part B which is concerned with comparing the
   theoretical predictions with experimental results and assessing the
   accuracy and maturity of the methods. This paper provides details of the
   background to third world-wide failure exercise, the process of
   completing Part A and a summary of key conclusions.}},

   (ASR) deterioration of concrete structures}},
Journal = {{CEMENT \& CONCRETE COMPOSITES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{41}},
Pages = {{45-59}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{A large number of structures especially in high humidity environments
   are endangered by Alkali-Silica Reaction (ASR). ASR leads to the
   formation of an expansive gel that imbibes water over time. The gel
   expansion causes cracking and consequent deterioration of concrete
   mechanical behavior in the form of strength and stiffness reduction. In
   the recent past, many research efforts were directed towards evaluation,
   modeling and treatment of ASR effects on structures but a comprehensive
   computational model is still lacking. In this paper, the ASR effect is
   implemented within the framework of the Lattice Discrete Particle Model
   (LDPM), which simulates concrete heterogeneous character at the scale of
   coarse aggregate pieces. The proposed formulation, entitled ASR-LDPM,
   allows precise and unique modeling of volumetric expansion; expansion
   anisotropy under applied load; non-uniform cracking distribution;
   concrete strength and stiffness degradation; alkali ion concentration
   effect; and temperature effects of concrete subjected to ASR. In
   addition, a unique advantage of this formulation is its ability to
   distinguish between the expansion directly related to ASR gel expansion
   and the one associated with cracking. Simulation of experimental data
   gathered from the literature demonstrates the ability of ASR-LDPM to
   predict accurately ASR-induced concrete deterioration. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{54}},
Pages = {{14-20}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Fatigue limit determination via the conventional Wohler-curve method is
   associated with extended experimental times as it requires testing of a
   large number of specimens. The current paper introduces a methodology
   for fast, reliable and experimentally economic determination of the
   fatigue limit in monolithic and composite materials by means of combined
   usage of two nondestructive inspection methods, namely infrared (IR)
   lock-in thermography and acoustic emission (AE). IR thermography, as a
   real-time and non-contact technique, allowed the detection of heat waves
   generated due to thermo-mechanical coupling as well as of the energy
   dissipated intrinsically during dynamic loading of the material. AE, on
   the other hand, was employed to record the transient waves resulting
   from crack propagation events. Aluminum grade 1050 H16 and cross-ply
   SiC/BMAS ceramic matrix composites were subjected to fatigue loading at
   various stress levels and were monitored by an IR camera and AE sensors.
   The fatigue limit of the monolithic material, obtained by the lock-in
   infrared thermography technique and supported by acoustic emission was
   found to be in agreement with measurements obtained by the conventional
   S-N curve method. The fatigue limit of the ceramic matrix composite was
   validated with acoustic emission data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This article reports a novel hybrid multiscale carbon-fiber/epoxy
   composite reinforced with self-healing core-shell nanofibers at
   interfaces. The ultrathin self-healing fibers were fabricated by means
   of coelectrospinning, in which liquid dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) as the
   healing agent was enwrapped into polyacrylonitrile (PAN) to form
   core-shell DCPD/PAN nanofibers. These core-shell nanofibers were
   incorporated at interfaces of neighboring carbon-fiber fabrics prior to
   resin infusion and formed into ultrathin self-healing interlayers after
   resin infusion and curing. The core-shell DCPD/PAN fibers are expected
   to function to self-repair the interfacial damages in composite
   laminates, e.g., delamination. Wet layup, followed by vacuum-assisted
   resin transfer molding (VARTM) technique, was used to process the
   proof-of-concept hybrid multiscale self-healing composite. Three-point
   bending test was utilized to evaluate the self-healing effect of the
   core-shell nanofibers on the flexural stiffness of the composite
   laminate after predamage failure. Experimental results indicate that the
   flexural stiffness of such novel self-healing composite after predamage
   failure can be completely recovered by the self-healing nanofiber
   interlayers. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was utilized for
   fractographical analysis of the failed samples. SEM micrographs clearly
   evidenced the release of healing agent at laminate interfaces and the
   toughening and self-healing mechanisms of the core-shell nanofibers.
   This study expects a family of novel high-strength, lightweight
   structural polymer composites with self-healing function for potential
   use in aerospace and aeronautical structures, sports utilities, etc. (c)

Abstract = {{Designing lightweight high-performance materials that can sustain high
   impulsive loadings is of great interest for marine applications. In this
   study, a finite element fluid-structure interaction model was developed
   to understand the deformation and failure mechanisms of both monolithic
   and sandwich composite panels. Fiber (E-glass fiber) and matrix
   (vinylester resin) damage and degradation in individual unidirectional
   composite laminas were modeled using Hashin failure model. The
   delamination between laminas was modeled by a strain-rate sensitive
   cohesive law. In sandwich panels, core compaction (H250 PVC foam) is
   modeled by a crushable foam plasticity model with volumetric hardening
   and strain-rate sensitivity. The model-predicted deformation histories,
   fiber/matrix damage patterns, and inter-lamina delamination, in both
   monolithic and sandwich composite panels, were compared with
   experimental observations. The simulations demonstrated that the
   delamination process is strongly rate dependent, and that Hashin model
   captures the spatial distribution and magnitude of damage to a
   first-order approximation. The model also revealed that the foam plays
   an important role in improving panel performance by mitigating the
   transmitted impulse to the back-side face sheet while maintaining
   overall bending stiffness. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental and modeling study of factors influencing intergranular
   corrosion (IGC) penetration depth into an Al-Mg alloy, AA5083 (UNS
   A95083), is presented. Potentiostatic tests over a range of potentials
   in 0.6 M sodium chloride (NaCl) solution were conducted on longitudinal
   by long transverse (LT), long transverse by short transverse (ST), and
   longitudinal by short transverse (LS) surfaces of sensitized AA5083. The
   IGC penetration rate was found to depend on applied potential, degree of
   sensitization (DoS), exposure time, and propagation direction relative
   to the rolling direction. Statistical IGC depth distributions were
   analyzed and served as inputs for a phenomenological model to estimate
   IGC damage progression for AA5083 during exposure to 0.6 M NaCl solution
   at pH 8.3. This model was validated by comparing the model predicted and
   experimental depths for the 100 degrees C sensitization condition.
   Extension of this combined experimental and modeling approach to the 80
   degrees C sensitization demonstrated that sensitization temperature is
   another significant factor in IGC penetration depths.}},

Abstract = {{The ductile damage mechanisms dominating in modern high-strength steels
   have emphasised the significance of the onset of damage and the

   contributes to the modelling of the plasticity and ductile damage

   mechanics approach derived from the combination of different types of
   damage models. It addresses the influence of stress state on the
   plasticity behaviour and onset of damage of materials, and quantifies
   the microstructure degradation using a dissipation-energy-based damage
   evolution law. The model is implemented into ABAQUS/Explicit by means of
   a user material subroutine (VUMAT) and applied to the subsequent
   numerical simulations. A hybrid experimental and numerical approach is
   employed to calibrate the material parameters, and the detailed program
   is demonstrated. The calibrated parameters and the model are then
   verified by experiments at different levels, and a good agreement

Abstract = {{Introduction: The purpose of this ex vivo study was to observe the
   incidence of cracks in root dentin after root canal preparation with
   hand files, self-adjusting file (SAF), ProTaper, and Mtwo. Methods: One
   hundred extracted mandibular premolars with single canals were randomly
   selected. Two angulated radiographs were taken for each tooth, and the
   width of the canal was measured at 9 mm from the apex. Five groups of 20
   teeth each were comparable in canal width. The control group was left
   unprepared. Four experimental groups were instrumented with hand files,
   ProTaper, Mtwo, and SAF. Roots were then sectioned horizontally and
   observed under a microscope. The presence of dentinal cracks and their
   location were noted. The difference between the experimental groups was
   analyzed with a chi(2) test. Results: No cracks were observed in the
   control group. In the experimental groups, ProTaper, Mtwo, and SAF
   caused cracks in 35\%, 25\%, and 10\% of teeth, respectively. The
   hand-file group did not show any dentinal cracks (P < .0001). ProTaper
   and Mtwo caused more cracks than hand files (P < .05), but SAF did not
   (P > .05). Conclusions: Instrumentation of root canals with SAF, Mtwo,
   and ProTaper could cause damage to root canal dentin. SAF has a tendency
   to cause less dentinal cracks as compared with ProTaper or Mtwo. (J

Title = {{Multifunctional properties of carbon nanotube/fly ash geopolymeric
   nanocomposites}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{46-55}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Fly ash-based geopolymers are currently being considered as a viable
   replacement to ordinary Portland cement (OPC) due to multifold benefits
   such as cost efficiency, chemical stability, corrosion resistance, rapid
   strength gain rate, low shrinkage and freeze-thaw resistance. However,
   geopolymers tend to be more brittle than OPC and thus unsuitable for
   concrete structures due to safety concerns. Geopolymers with improved
   electrical properties can also be used as self-sensing materials capable
   of detect their own structural damage. Therefore, this paper is aimed at
   investigating the effect of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) on the
   mechanical and electrical properties of fly ash (FA) geopolymeric
   composites. Geopolymeric matrices containing different MWCNTs
   concentrations (0.0\%, 0.1\%, 0.5\% and 1.0\% by weight) were
   synthesized and their mechanical properties (i.e., flexural strength,
   Young's modulus, flexural toughness and fracture energy), electrical
   conductivity and piezoresistive response were determined. A scanning
   electron microscope (SEM) was employed to evaluate the distribution
   quality of MWCNTs within the matrix and determine their crack-bridging
   mechanism. The experimental results showed that the MWCNTs were
   uniformly distributed within the matrix at 0.1 and 0.5-wt\% and they
   were poorly distributed and severely agglomerated within the matrix at
   1-wt\%. The experimental results also showed that the addition of MWCNTs
   increased the flexural strength, Young's modulus and flexural toughness
   by as much as 160\%, 109\% and 275\%, respectively. The MWCNTs also
   enhanced the fracture energy and increased the electrical conductivity
   by 194\%. The geopolymeric nanocomposites exhibited a piezoresistive
   response with high sensitivity to micro-crack propagation. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new damage detection methodology for beams. It
   applies wavelet analysis to locate the damage from changes in the mode
   shapes (geometric based analysis). The proposed methodology requires the
   mode shapes of a reference undamaged state as well as those of the
   potentially damaged one. Once obtained, a continuous wavelet transform
   is applied to the difference of the mode shape vectors to obtain
   information of the changes in each of them. Finally, the results for
   each mode are added up to compute an overall result along the structure.
   For the addition, the wavelet coefficients of each mode are weighted
   according to the corresponding variation of the natural frequency. By
   doing so, emphasis is given on those modes that are more likely to be
   affected by damage. On the other hand, mode shapes that have not changed
   their natural frequencies are disregarded. The proposed methodology also
   includes mathematical techniques to avoid wavelet transform edge effect,
   experimental noise reduction in mode shapes and creation of new virtual
   measuring points. It has been validated by experimental analysis of
   steel beams with cracks of different sizes and at different locations.
   The results show that the method is sensitive to little damage. The
   paper analyses the severity threshold of damage and the required number
   of sensors to obtain successful results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{14-31}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a comprehensive experimental study and detailed
   mechanistic interpretations of the tensile behavior of one
   representative 3D non-crimp orthogonal woven (3DNCOW) carbon/epoxy
   composite. The composite is tested under uniaxial in-plane tensile
   loading in the warp, fill and +/- 45 degrees bias directions. An
   ``S-shape{''} nonlinearity observed in the stress-strain curves is
   explained by the concurrent contributions of inherent carbon fiber
   stiffening ({''}non-Hookean behavior{''}), fiber straightening, and
   gradual damage accumulation. Several approaches to the determination of
   a single-value Young's modulus from a significantly nonlinear
   stress-strain curve are discussed and the best approach recommended.
   Also, issues related to the experimental determination of effective
   Poisson's ratios for this class of composites are discussed, and their
   possible resolution suggested. The observed experimental values of the
   warp- and fill-directional tensile strengths are much higher than those
   typically obtained for 3D interlock weave carbon/epoxy composites while
   the nonlinear material behavior observed for the +/- 45
   degrees-directional tensile loading is in a qualitative agreement with
   the earlier results for other textile composites. Results of the damage
   initiation and progression, monitoried by means of acoustic emission,
   full-field strain optical measurements, X-rays and optical microscopy,
   are illustrated and discussed in detail. The damage modes at different
   stages of the increasing tensile loading are analyzed, and the principal
   progressive damage mechanisms identified, including the characteristic
   crack patterns developed at each damage stage. It is concluded that
   significant damage initiation of the present material occurs in the same
   strain range as in traditional cross-ply laminates, while respective
   strain range for other previously studied carbon/epoxy textile
   composites is significantly lower. Overall the revealed advantages in
   stiffness, strength and progressive damage behavior of the studied
   composite are mainly attributed to the absence of crimp and only minimal
   fiber waviness in the reinforcing 3DNCOW preform. C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

   oscillatory motions. Once these connected components undergo cyclic
   fatigue load, fretting fatigue occurs. In general, fretting fatigue
   failure process can be divided into two main portions, namely crack
   initiation and crack propagation. Fretting fatigue crack initiation
   characteristics are very difficult to detect because damages such as
   micro-cracks are always hidden between two contact surfaces.
   In this paper Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) approach in conjunction
   with Finite Element Analyses (FEA) is used to find a predictor tool for
   fretting fatigue crack initiation lifetime. For this purpose an
   uncoupled damage evolution law is developed to model fretting fatigue
   crack initiation lifetime at various fretting condition such as contact
   geometry, axial stress, normal load and tangential load. The predicted
   results are validated with published experimental data from literature.

Abstract = {{With the development of high-strength materials, the existing fatigue
   strength formulae cannot satisfactorily describe the relation between
   fatigue strength sigma(w) and tensile strength sigma(b) of metallic
   materials with a wide range of strength. For a simple but more precise
   prediction, the tensile and fatigue properties of SAE 4340 steel with
   the tensile strengths ranging from 1290 MPa to 2130 MPa obtained in
   virtue of different tempering temperatures were studied in this paper.
   Based on the experimental results of SAE 4340 steel and numerous other
   data available (conventional and newly developed materials), through
   introducing a sensitive factor of defects P, a new universal fatigue
   strength formula sigma(w)=sigma(b)(C-P.sigma(b)) was established for the
   first time. Combining the variation tendency of fatigue crack initiation
   sites and the competition of defects, the fatigue damage mechanisms
   associated with different tensile strengths and cracking sites are
   explained well. The decrease in the fatigue strength at high-strength
   level can be explained by fracture mechanics and attributed to the
   transition of fatigue cracking sites from surface to the inner
   inclusions, resulting in the maximum fatigue strength sigma(max)(w) at
   an appropriate tensile strength level. Therefore, the universal fatigue
   strength formula cannot only explain why many metallic materials with
   excessively high strength do not display high fatigue strength, but also
   provide a new clue for designing the materials or eliminating the
   processing defects of the materials. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The description of fatigue crack growth in metals has remained an
   empirical field. To address the physical processes contributing to crack
   advance a model for fatigue crack growth (FCG) has been developed
   utilizing a combined atomistic-continuum approach. In particular, the
   model addresses the important topic of the role of nanoscale coherent
   twin boundaries (CTB) on FCG. We make the central observation that FCG
   is governed by the dislocation glide resistance and the irreversibility
   of crack tip displacement, both influenced by the presence of CTBs. The
   energy barriers for dislocation slip under cyclical conditions are
   calculated as the glide dislocation approaches a twin boundary and
   reacts with the CTB. The atomistically calculated energy barriers
   provide input to a mechanics model for dislocations gliding in a forward
   and reverse manner. This approach allows the irreversibility of
   displacement at the crack tip, defined as the difference between forward
   and reverse flow, to be determined. The simulation results demonstrate
   that for both refinement of twin thickness and a decrease in crack tip
   to twin spacing FCG resistance improves, in agreement with recent
   experimental findings reported in the literature. (C) 2013 Acta

   structures of large dimensions considering crack effects}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{306-326}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A probabilistic model for chloride induced corrosion of the reinforcing
   steel in concrete structures is presented in this work. The main purpose
   of this model is to simulate the complex phenomena involved in a
   detailed yet simple way, appropriate for implementation on large-scale,
   real structures. Addressing this problem a time-dependent model is
   developed that can simulate all stages of reinforced concrete corrosion,
   i.e. corrosion initiation, crack initiation and propagation. The
   novelties of the formulation include a new empirical model for the crack
   propagation stage, which combines corrosion crack width with steel-bar
   cross sectional loss, based on published experimental results, and the
   dynamic influence of propagating cracks on the corrosion mechanism.
   Probabilistic concepts are also employed due to numerous sources of
   uncertainty in the degradation model and the extent of damage is
   quantified by considering the spatial variability of the various
   parameters. Probability density functions for certain variables and
   random model parts are suggested as well. A numerical application and a
   critical discussion are presented at the end. Finally, due to the
   variety of covered topics and the extensive reference list, the paper
   can also serve a secondary purpose as a state-of-the-art review source.

Abstract = {{A continuum mechanics-based viscodamage (VD) constitutive relationship
   is proposed to model fatigue damage of asphalt concrete. The form for
   the evolution of the viscodamage function is postulated based on the
   damage density which was determined from uniaxial constant strain rate
   tests that were performed at different strain rates. The proposed
   viscodamage model is coupled with Schapery's nonlinear viscoelastic
   (VE), Perzyna's viscoplastic (VP), and micro-damage healing (H) models
   to simulate the nonlinear mechanical response of asphalt concrete during
   fatigue. Numerical algorithms are implemented in the finite element code
   Abaqus via the user material subroutine UMAT. The proposed model is
   validated against extensive experimental data including constant strain
   rate, cyclic displacement controlled, and cyclic stress controlled tests
   over a range of temperatures, strain rates, loading frequencies, and
   stress/strain levels/amplitudes. The model predictions show that the
   VE-VP-VD-H model is capable of predicting the fatigue damage response of
   asphalt concrete subjected to different loading conditions. The results
   demonstrate that micro-damage healing occurs not only during the rest
   period, but also during the cyclic strain controlled tests even in the
   absence of the resting time. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Identification of defects in structures and its components is a crucial
   aspect in decision making about their repair and total replacement.
   Failure to detect the faults has various consequences, and sometimes may
   lead to a catastrophic failure. The conducted research work reported
   analytical and experimental investigations on the effects of a crack on
   the cantilever steel beam with circular cross section. The objective of
   this review is to quantify and to determine the extent of the damage
   magnitude and the location of the cantilever beams. In analytical study,
   finite element method (FEA) software was used in developing the model.
   The results showed that, by monitoring the change of the natural
   frequency it is a feasible and viable tool to indicate the damage
   occurrence and magnitude. Unlike for small crack depth, the natural
   frequencies are not a good damage detector. Mode shapes indicated good
   sensitivity to detect the damage magnitude for all crack parameters.
   Frequency Reduction Index (FRI) and Modal Assurance Criteria (MAC) were
   found to be in order a feasible tool to find the magnitude of the damage
   in beam structures. While, Coordinate Modal Assurance Criteria (COMAC)
   and Curvature Change Index (CCI) were used to predict the location of
   the crack tested beams and proved to be feasible. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Reinforced concrete is subjected to deterioration due to aging,
   increased load, and natural hazards. To minimize the maintenance costs
   and to increase the operation lifetime, researchers and practitioners
   are increasingly interested in improving current nondestructive
   evaluation technologies or building advanced structural health
   monitoring strategies. Acoustic emission methods offer an attractive
   solution for nondestructive evaluation/structural health monitoring of
   reinforced concrete structures. In particular, monitoring the
   development of cracks is of large interest because their properties
   reflect not only the condition of concrete as material but also the
   condition of the entire system at structural level. This article
   presents a new probabilistic approach based on Gaussian mixture modeling
   of acoustic emission to classify crack modes in reinforced concrete
   structures. Experimental results obtained in a full-scale reinforced
   concrete shear wall subjected to reversed cyclic loading are used to
   demonstrate and validate the proposed approach.}},

   impact}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{17-30}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In the present study, the effectiveness of hybrid-fibers (a combination
   of steel and plastic fibers) in improving the impact resistance of slabs
   was studied through a detailed experimental program. A total of 54
   hybrid-fiber reinforced slabs were cast in the two groups; each group
   containing 27 slabs. The specimens of the first group were cast using
   normal strength concrete, whereas specimens of second group were cast
   using high strength concrete. All the slabs were 600 x 600 x 90 mm and
   contained different proportions of steel and plastic fibers. Out of a
   total number of 54 slabs, three slabs in each group were used as control
   specimens i.e. without fibers. The impact penetration tests were carried
   out using an air-gun system. The projectiles were made of hardened steel
   and were bi-conic in shape. Failures of the specimens were observed and
   size of the front and the rear face craters and the penetration depths
   were measured. The test results showed that the hybrid-fibers in the
   concrete lead to smaller crater volumes and reduce the spalling and
   scabbing damage. The hybrid-fibers arrest the crack development and thus
   minimize the size of the damaged area. The penetration depth and
   perforation thickness were predicted by modifying the impact function of
   NDRC equation to incorporate the effects of hybrid-fibers. The ballistic
   limit was also predicted. A simple formulation was then proposed for the
   prediction of the ejected concrete mass from the front and the rear
   faces of the specimens. Predictions matched well with the experimental
   observations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Vibration-based inverse algorithms for detection of delamination in
   composites}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{102}},
Pages = {{226-236}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Delamination is a frequent and potentially serious damage that can occur
   in laminated polymer composites due to the poor inter-laminar fracture
   toughness of the matrix. Vibration based detection methods employ
   changes caused by loss of stiffness in dynamic parameters such as
   frequencies to detect and assess damage. One of the challenges of using
   frequency shift for damage detection is that while the presence of
   damage is easily identified through a shift in measured frequency, the
   determination of the location and the severity of the damage are not
   easy to accomplish. To determine the location and severity of damage
   from measured changes in frequency, it is necessary to solve the inverse
   problem, which requires the solution of a set of non-linear simultaneous
   equations. In this paper, we examine three different inverse algorithms
   for solving the non-linear equations to predict the interface,
   lengthwise location and size of delamination: direct of solution using a
   graphical method, artificial neural network (ANN) and surrogate-based
   optimization. The three inverse algorithms have been validated using
   numerical data generated from the finite element model (FEM) of
   delaminated beams and measured frequencies from modal testing conducted
   on simply supported and cantilever carbon fiber reinforced beam
   specimens. Results show that all three algorithms can predict the
   delamination parameters accurately using the validation data directly
   generated from FE model. However, if using experimental data from real
   beams, ANN does not fare as well as the other two methods as it is more
   sensitive to the measurement errors. Finally, the advantages and
   limitations of each method have been summarized to provide a useful
   guide for selecting inverse algorithms for vibration-based delamination
   detection. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{97-114}},
Month = {{APR 18}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental investigation of the mechanical
   response of a new class of advanced composite materials manufactured
   using thin non-crimp fabrics. Tensile and compressive tests in both
   unnotched and notched specimens were performed using two different
   lay-ups. The notched tests were based on specimens with central cracks
   and with circular holes, loaded in tension and compression. Digital
   image correlation was used to monitor the onset and propagation of
   damage on the surface plies. The results show that the lay-up with
   blocked plies and with higher differences in fiber orientation angles
   between consecutive plies has lower unnotched strength. However, due to
   the larger fracture process zone observed in the notched tests, such
   lay-up has marginally higher notched strengths. A size effect on the
   strength was observed for both the open-hole tension and compression
   tests. The size effect and the associated notch sensitivity of thin
   non-crimp fabrics were similar to those observed in typical aerospace
   grade unidirectional pre-impregnated composite materials. It is also
   concluded that the thin non-crimp fabrics exhibit an improved response
   to bolt-bearing loads over traditional composite materials. (C) 2013

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1197-1203}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of fatigue damage is intimately related to different types
   of more or less pronounced irreversible cyclic slip, associated with
   gradual permanent microstructural and topological changes which
   ultimately can cause fatigue failure. Only in a few cases has it been
   possible to assess quantitatively the cyclic slip irreversibility. Based
   on a limited amount of available experimental data amenable to analysis,
   an attempt is made in this work to explore whether there exists an
   explicit relationship between the cyclic slip irreversibility and
   fatigue life. The existence of such a relationship is suggested by a
   microstructure-based reformulation of the Coffin-Manson fatigue life
   law, which involves the cyclic slip irreversibility. The analysis of the
   experimental data in two adequately documented cases indicates that the
   cyclic slip irreversibility is related very satisfactorily to fatigue
   life via a power law which contains two constants. These two constants
   can be expressed in terms of the fatigue ductility coefficient and the
   fatigue ductility exponent of the Coffin-Manson fatigue life law. (C)

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{179-189}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{An experimental investigation on the local fracture resistance and crack
   growth behavior in a Alloy52M dissimilar metal welded joint (DMWJ)
   between A508 ferritic steel and 316L stainless steel has been carried
   out by using the single-edge notched bend (SENB) specimens. The local
   J-resistance curves and crack growth paths of 13 cracks located at
   various positions in the DMWJ were determined, and the effects of the
   local strength mismatch on local fracture resistance, crack growth paths
   and integrity assessment for the DMWJ were analyzed. The results show
   that the cracks always deviate to the materials with lower strength, and
   the crack path deviations are mainly controlled by the strength
   mismatch, rather than toughness mismatch. The J-resistance curve with
   larger crack path deviation only reflect the apparent fracture
   resistance along the crack growth region, rather than the intrinsic
   fracture resistance of the material at the initial crack-tip region.
   Without considering the local fracture resistance properties of heat
   affected zone (HAZ), interface and near interface zone, the use of the
   J-resistance curves of base metals or weld metals following present
   codes will unavoidably produce non-conservative (unsafe) or excessive
   conservative assessment results. In most cases, the assessment results
   will be potentially unsafe. Therefore, it is recommended to obtain and
   use local mechanical and fracture resistance properties of all regions
   of the DMWJ if the complex local mismatch situation is a concern. And
   new integrity assessment methods based on local damage and fracture
   models also need to be developed for the DMWJs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Effective and reliable clinical uses of dental ceramics necessitate an
   insightful analysis of the fracture behaviour under critical conditions.
   To better understand failure characteristics of porcelain veneered to
   zirconia core ceramic structures, thermally induced cracking during the
   cooling phase of fabrication is studied here by using the extended
   finite element method (XFEM). In this study, a transient thermal
   analysis of cooling is conducted first to determine the temperature
   distributions. The time-dependent temperature field is then imported to
   the XFEM model for viscoelastic thermomechanical analysis, which
   predicts thermally induced damage and cracking at different time steps.
   Temperature-dependent material properties are used in both transient
   thermal and thermomechanical analyses. Three typical ceramic structures
   are considered in this paper, namely bi-layered spheres, squat cylinders
   and dental crowns with thickness ratios of either 1:2 or 1:1. The XFEM
   fracture patterns exhibit good agreement with clinical observation and
   the in vitro experimental results obtained from scanning electron
   microscopy characterization. The study reveals that fast cooling can
   lead to thermal fracture of these different bi-layered ceramic
   structures, and cooling rate (in terms of heat transfer coefficient)
   plays a critical role in crack initiation and propagation. By exploring
   different cooling rates, the heat transfer coefficient thresholds of
   fracture are determined for different structures, which are of clear
   clinical implication. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{In this paper, a study on skin delamination growth in stiffened
   composite panels made of carbon fibres reinforced polymers and subjected
   to compressive load is presented. A robust (mesh and time step
   independent) numerical finite elements procedure, based on the Virtual

   here to investigate the influence of skin delamination size and position
   on the damage tolerance of stiffened composite panels. Four stiffened
   panels configurations with skin delaminations differently sized and
   positioned are introduced. Bay delaminations and delaminations under the
   stringer foot are considered. The novel numerical procedure has been
   used to simulate the delamination growth for all the investigated panel
   configurations and to evaluate the influence of the delaminations'
   geometrical parameters on the growth development. As a confirmation of
   the applicability and effectiveness of the adopted numerical tool, the
   numerical results, obtained for all the analysed configurations, in
   terms of grown delaminated area, displacements and strains measured in
   various panel locations, have been compared with experimental data

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The addition of long carbon fibers to traditional reinforced concrete is
   proposed as a method to improve the blast spalling resistance of
   concrete. A series of tests was conducted to compare the blast
   resistance of panels constructed with either conventional reinforced
   concrete (RC) or long carbon fiber-reinforced concrete (LCFRC).
   Conventional reinforced concrete panels were tested as control
   specimens. Pressure sensors measured both the free-field incident
   pressure and the reflected pressure for each panel. Furthermore, a
   finite element model was created in LS-DYNA to replicate both a control
   panel and an LCFRC panel to observe whether or not the models could
   predict the observed damage. Each of the LCFRC panels exhibited less
   material loss and less surface damage than the control panels. The
   addition of long carbon fibers significantly increased the concrete's
   blast resistance and significantly reduced the degree of cracking
   associated with the concrete panels. The results were also compared to
   the existing damage level chart (UFC 3-340-02). A comparison of the
   results indicates that the finite element modeling approach adopted in
   this study provides an adequate representation of both RC and LCFRC
   experimental responses. The results can be used in blast modeling with a
   reasonable degree of accuracy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, the pyramidal truss core sandwich structures consisting
   of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) facesheets and aluminum alloy
   cores were manufactured based on the slot-fitting method. This hybrid
   concept is to maximize the specific bending stiffness/strength as well
   as obtain excellent energy absorption ability. Quasi-static compression
   tests were conducted to get the stress-strain curves and to evaluate the
   energy absorption mechanism. Low velocity impact tests were carried out
   to investigate the damage resistance of such structures. The compressive
   measurements show that the low density aluminum alloy pyramidal truss
   cores have superior energy absorption ability compared with other
   lightweight lattice cores. In the impact tests, the failure of matrix
   cracking, fiber breakage, delamination of CFRP facesheets and buckling
   of truss members occurred and the extent of damage was significantly
   affected by the impact site. In addition to experimental testing, finite
   element models for compression and impact simulations have been
   developed using ABAQUS software. The numerical results were validated
   compared with the experimental tests. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{To investigate the fracture behaviour of polygranular graphite (a
   quasi-brittle material), crack propagation in a short bar chevron
   notched specimen was studied by synchrotron X-ray computed tomography
   combined with digital volume correlation. Displacements were measured
   within the loaded test specimen, particularly the three-dimensional
   (3-D) profile of crack opening displacement. Analysis of the 3-D
   displacement field confirmed the existence of distributed damage in a
   fracture process zone, which significantly increased the effective crack
   length. Finite element simulations affirmed that the measured crack
   opening profiles could be reproduced using a cohesive zone model, but
   not with a linear elastic analysis. Comparing the simulation to the
   experimental results, it was deduced that the critical strain energy
   release rate varied across the crack front, i.e. the fracture toughness
   is constraint-dependent. This is proposed to be a general characteristic
   of quasi-brittle materials. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{80-89}},

Abstract = {{Particle clustering originated from manufacturing process is thought to
   be one of the critical factors to the mechanical performance of hollow
   spheres filled syntactic foams. Although experimental evidence provides
   a qualitative understanding of the effects of particle clustering on the
   mechanical properties of syntactic foams, a quantitative assessment
   cannot be made in the absence of an appropriate micromechanical modeling
   strategy. In this study, three-dimensional microstructures of syntactic
   foams with different degrees of particle clustering were reconstructed
   based on random sequential adsorption (RSA) method. Three-phase finite
   element models considering the progressive damage behavior of the
   microsphere-matrix interface were accordingly developed by means of
   representative volume element (RVE) to quantitatively investigate the
   effects of particle clustering on the tensile properties and failure
   mechanisms of syntactic foams. The simulation results indicate that the
   elastic behavior of syntactic foams is insensitive to the degree of
   particle clustering, but the strength properties as well as the failure
   mechanisms are significantly influenced by the degree of particle
   clustering. From the micromechanical viewpoint, the clustered regions
   containing higher concentration of microspheres than the average volume
   fraction would serve as crack initiation sites due to stress
   concentration, and consequently lead to a negative effect on tensile
   strength, fracture strain, and interfacial damage of syntactic foams.

   The failure criteria are used to predict not only the onset of the

   information is used in a smeared crack model for transverse cracking
   that imposes a linear softening relation between the traction acting on
   the fracture planes and the crack opening displacements. The
   longitudinal failure mechanisms are represented using bi-linear
   softening relations. The model is validated using off-axis compression
   tests performed in unidirectional specimens as well as using tensile
   tests in notched multidirectional laminates. A good correlation between
   experimental observations and numerical predictions is obtained. (c)

Title = {{Thermal weakening of the carbonate basement under Mt. Etna volcano
   (Italy): Implications for volcano instability}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{250}},
Pages = {{42-60}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{The physical integrity of a sub-volcanic basement is crucial in
   controlling the stability of a volcanic edifice. For many volcanoes,
   this basement can comprise thick sequences of carbonates that are prone
   to significant thermally-induced alteration. These debilitating thermal
   reactions, facilitated by heat from proximal magma storage volumes,
   promote the weakening of the rock mass and likely therefore encourage
   edifice instability. Such instability can result in slow, gravitational
   spreading and episodic to continuous slippage of unstable flanks, and
   may also facilitate catastrophic flank collapse. Understanding the
   propensity of a particular sub-volcanic basement to such instability
   requires a detailed understanding of the influence of high temperatures
   on the chemical, physical, and mechanical properties of the rocks
   involved. The juxtaposition of a thick carbonate substratum and magmatic
   heat sources makes Mt Etna volcano an ideal candidate for our study. We
   investigated experimentally the effect of temperature on two carbonate
   rocks that have been chosen to represent the deep, heterogeneous
   sedimentary substratum under Mt. Etna volcano. This study has
   demonstrated that thermal-stressing resulted in a progressive and
   significant change in the physical properties of the two rocks.
   Porosity, wet (i.e., water-saturated) dynamic Poisson's ratio and wet
   Vp/Vs ratio all increased, whilst P- and S-wave velocities, bulk sample
   density, dynamic and static Young's modulus, dry Vp/Vs ratio, and dry
   dynamic Poisson's ratio all decreased. At temperatures of 800 degrees C,
   the carbonate in these rocks completely dissociated, resulting in a
   total mass loss of about 45\% and the release of about 44 wt\% of CO2.
   Uniaxial deformation experiments showed that high in-situ temperatures
   (>500 degrees C) significantly reduced the strength of the carbonates
   and altered their deformation behaviour. Above 500 C the rocks deformed
   in a ductile manner and the output of acoustic emissions was greatly
   reduced. We speculate that thermally-induced weakening and the ductile
   behaviour of the carbonate substratum could be a key factor in
   explaining the large-scale deformation observed at Mt Etna volcano. Our
   findings are consistent with several field observations at Mt Etna
   volcano and can quantitatively support the interpretation of (1) the
   irregularly low seismic velocity zones present within the sub-volcanic
   sedimentary basement, (2) the anomalously high CO2 degassing observed,
   (3) the anomalously high Vp/Vs ratios and the rapid migration of fluids,
   and (4) the increasing instability of volcanic edifices in the lifespan
   of a magmatic system. We speculate that carbonate sub-volcanic basement
   may emerge as one of the decisive fundamentals in controlling volcanic
   stability. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The multimodal characteristic of Lamb waves makes the interpretation of
   Lamb wave signals difficult in either the time or frequency domain. In
   this work, we present our study of Lamb wave propagation
   characterization and crack scattering using frequency-wavenumber
   analysis. The aim is to investigate three dimensional (3D) Lamb wave
   behavior in the presence of crack damage via the application of
   frequency-wavenumber analysis. The analysis techniques are demonstrated
   using simulation examples of an aluminum plate with a through-thickness
   crack. Both in-plane and out-of-plane components are acquired through a
   3D elastodynamic finite integration technique (EFIT), while the
   out-of-plane component is also experimentally obtained using a scanning
   laser Doppler vibrometer for verification purposes. The time-space
   wavefield is then transformed to the frequency-wavenumber domain by a
   two dimensional (2D) Fourier transform and the out-of-plane EFIT results
   are compared to experimental measurements. The experimental and
   simulated results are found to be in close agreement. The
   frequency-wavenumber representation of in-plane and out-of-plane
   components shows clear distinction among various Lamb wave modes that
   are present. However, spatial information is lost during this 2D
   transformation. A short space 2D Fourier transform is therefore adopted
   to obtain the frequency-wavenumber spectra at various spatial locations,
   resulting in a space-frequency-wavenumber representation of the signal.
   The space-frequency-wavenumber analysis has shown its potential for
   indicating crack presence.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this present work is to identify and localize the defect in
   gear and measure the angle between two damaged teeth in the time domain
   of the vibration signal. The vibration signals are captured from the
   experiments and the burst in the vibration signal is focused in the
   analysis. The enveloping technique is revisited for defect
   identification but is found unsatisfactory in measuring the angle
   between two faulty teeth. A signal processing scheme is proposed to
   filter the noise and to measure the angle between two damaged teeth. The
   proposed technique consists of undecimated wavelet transform (UWT),
   which is used to denoise the signal. The analytic wavelet transform
   (AWT) has been implemented on approximation signal followed by a time
   marginal integration (TMI) of the AWT scalogram. The TMI graph time-axis
   is mapped onto the angular displacement of the driver gear. The
   measurement is shown to identify the first and the second defective
   teeth impact on gear meshing, which is visible as sharp spikes in the
   TMI graph. An attempt is also made to replace the approximation from UWT
   with Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) derived from the Empirical Mode
   Decomposition (EMD). The present experimental work establishes the
   proposed method of measuring and localizing multiple gear teeth defect
   using vibration signal in the time domain. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new constitutive model describing the mechanical
   behavior of concrete at early age and beyond. This model, entitled
   solidification-microprestress-microplane (SMM) model, amalgamates the
   microplane model and the solidification-microprestress theory and takes
   into account all the most significant aspects of concrete behavior, such
   as creep, shrinkage, thermal deformation, and cracking starting from the
   initial stages of curing up to several years of age. Age-dependent
   viscoelastic behavior under variable hygro-thermal conditions is
   described according to the solidification-microprestress theory.
   Cracking/damage behavior is modeled through an age-dependent microplane
   model, in which the model parameters are assumed to be dependent on an
   aging variable evolving with the extent of early-age chemical reactions
   (hydration, silica-fume reaction, etc.) and temperature. Calibration and
   validation of the model is performed by the numerical simulations of the
   age-dependent response of sealed and unsealed specimens subject to a
   variety of loading conditions and/or drying. Comparison with
   experimental data shows that the SMM model can reproduce well the
   interplay of shrinkage, creep, and cracking phenomena during curing and
   drying. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Percussive activities are highly relevant in the economy of modern
   hunter-gatherer societies and other primates, and are likely to have
   been equally important during the Palaeolithic. Despite the potential
   relevance of percussive activities in the Early Stone Age, attempts to
   study battered artefacts are still rare. In order to establish protocols
   of analysis of battered tools, this paper pursues an interdisciplinary
   approach combining techno-typological, refit, use-wear and GIS studies
   of experimental anvils from Olduvai Gorge (Tanzania). The main aim is to
   classify types of damage on battered artefacts according to the
   percussive task performed, and hence identify patterns that can be used
   to interpret the Oldowan and Acheulean evidence. Our results indicate
   that abrasion marks on anvil surfaces are typical of nut cracking, while
   bone breaking leaves characteristic scars and abrasion marks on the
   edges of anvils. Pounding of soft materials such as meat and plants also
   causes battering of anvils, producing morphological and spatial patterns
   that can be discerned from the heavy breakage of anvils during bipolar
   flaking. By integrating macroscopic, microscopic and spatial analyses of
   experimental stone tools, this paper contributes to create a referential
   framework in which Early Stone Age battered artefacts can be
   interpreted. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Numerical simulation of acoustic emission in brittle rocks by

Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{195}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{423-443}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Stress waves, known as acoustic emissions (AEs), are released by
   localized inelastic deformation events during the progressive failure of
   brittle rocks. Although several numerical models have been developed to
   simulate the deformation and damage processes of rocks, such as
   non-linear stress-strain behaviour and localization of failure, only a
   limited number have been capable of providing quantitative information
   regarding the associated seismicity. Moreover, the majority of these
   studies have adopted a pseudo-static approach based on elastic strain
   energy dissipation that completely disregards elastodynamic effects.
   This paper describes a new AE modelling technique based on the combined
   finite-discrete element method (FEM/DEM), a numerical tool that
   simulates material failure by explicitly considering fracture nucleation
   and propagation in the modelling domain. Given the explicit time
   integration scheme of the solver, stress wave propagation and the effect
   of radiated seismic energy can be directly captured. Quasi-dynamic
   seismic information is extracted from a FEM/DEM model with a newly
   developed algorithm based on the monitoring of internal variables (e.g.
   relative displacements and kinetic energy) in proximity to propagating
   cracks. The AE of a wing crack propagation model based on this algorithm
   are cross-analysed by traveltime inversion and energy estimation from
   seismic recordings. Results indicate a good correlation of AE initiation
   times and locations, and scaling of energies, independently calculated
   with the two methods. Finally, the modelling technique is validated by
   simulating a laboratory compression test on a granite sample. The
   micromechanical parameters of the heterogeneous model are first
   calibrated to reproduce the macroscopic stress-strain response measured
   during standard laboratory tests. Subsequently, AE frequency-magnitude
   statistics, spatial clustering of source locations and the evolution of
   AE rate are investigated. The distribution of event magnitude tends to
   decay as power law while the spatial distribution of sources exhibits a
   fractal character, in agreement with experimental observations.
   Moreover, the model can capture the decrease of seismic b value
   associated with the macrorupture of the rock sample and the transition
   of AE spatial distribution from diffuse, in the pre-peak stage, to
   strongly localized at the peak and post-peak stages, as reported in a
   number of published laboratory studies. In future studies, the validated
   FEM/DEM-AE modelling technique will be used to obtain further insights
   into the micromechanics of rock failure with potential applications
   ranging from laboratory-scale microcracking to engineering-scale
   processes (e.g. excavations within mines, tunnels and caverns, petroleum
   and geothermal reservoirs) to tectonic earthquakes triggering.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{125-151}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{For every dynamic problem an ad hoc model can be developed to reproduce
   the damage levels in materials. This work provides a unified model to
   capture low to high strain rate and ductile to brittle damage processes
   in dynamic problems with different dynamic energy densities. First a
   viscoplastic model for low to high strain rate responses of
   polycrystalline materials is developed. The established viscoplastic
   model shows excellent correlation between the simulations and
   experimental results for a wide range of strain rates while it can be
   readily calibrated with two set of the experimental results. The
   pressure and temperature dependent elastic material properties are
   incorporated to account for the effect of the pressure and temperature
   variations in dynamic problems. The microscale degradation processes,
   i.e., microcracking and microvoiding, are then correlated to the
   macroscale failure modes in which the transition between the ductile to
   brittle microfracture modes is attributed to stress triaxiality,
   shielding and blunting effects in microcracking, and rate-sensitivity.
   Also, as a complementary to previously developed ductile void growth
   models, a novel fracture mechanics based damage model is developed to
   describe the microcracking process. While microvoiding models, such as
   Johnson void model (Johnson, 1981), assume the hydrostatic part of the
   applied stress dominates the deformation mechanism, the developed
   microcracking model is suited for the problems with the dominant
   deviatoric stress. The develop model takes into account the effects of
   the ductile crack bunting and brittle crack cleavage and also the effect
   of the formation and propagation of the dislocation trails at the
   microcrack tip. The microscale damage mechanisms are then correlated to
   the macrofracture modes within the Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM)
   framework. The developed multiscale damage framework shows excellent
   flexibility to reproduce a wide variety of experimental results. Also
   the developed damage framework is capable of incorporating the
   stochastic analyses which can take into account the inherent
   uncertainties in the dynamic problems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights
