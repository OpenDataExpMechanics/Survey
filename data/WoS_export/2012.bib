Title = {{The brittle-ductile transition in porous rock: A review}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{25-53}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Many of the earliest laboratory studies of the brittle-ductile
   transition were on porous rocks, with a focus on the evolution of
   failure mode from brittle faulting to cataclastic flow with increasing
   pressure. Recent advances in this area are reviewed. Porosity has been
   demonstrated to exert critical control on the brittle-ductile
   transition, and its phenomenology has two common attributes. Under low
   confinement, brittle faulting develops as a dilatant failure mode. Under
   high confinement, delocalized cataclasis is accompanied by
   shear-enhanced compaction and strain hardening. Plasticity models such
   as the cap and critical state models have been developed to describe
   such constitutive behaviors, and many aspects of the laboratory data on
   porous rock have been shown to be in basic agreement. Bifurcation
   analysis can be used in conjunction with a constitutive model to predict
   the onset of strain localization, which is in qualitative agreement with
   the laboratory data. However, recent studies have also underscored
   certain complexities in the inelastic behavior and failure mode. In some
   porous sandstones, compaction bands would develop as a localized failure
   mode intermediate between the end members of brittle faulting and
   cataclastic flow. In limestones (and selected sandstones) under
   relatively high confinement, cataclastic flow is accompanied first by
   shear-enhanced compaction which then evolves to dilatancy. Various
   techniques have been employed to characterize the microstructure and
   damage, which have elucidated the deformation mechanisms associated with
   the brittle-ductile transition. These observations have revealed a
   diversity of micromechanical processes, and fundamental differences were
   observed especially between sandstone and limestone with regard to
   inelastic compaction. Micromechanical models that have been formulated
   to describe these processes include the pore-emanated and sliding wing
   crack models in the brittle faulting regime, and the Hertzian fracture
   and cataclastic pore collapse models in the cataclastic flow regime.
   Numerical techniques based on the discrete element method have also been
   employed to simulate these processes. Comparison of the model
   predictions with laboratory and microstructural observations has
   provided useful insights into the mechanics of brittle-ductile
   transition in porous rock. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cracking processes have been extensively studied in brittle rock and
   rock-like materials. Due to the experimental limitations and the
   complexity of rock texture, details of the cracking processes could not
   always be observed and assessed comprehensively. To contribute to this
   field of research, a numerical approach based on the particle element
   model was used in present study. It would give us insights into what is
   happening to crack initiation, propagation and coalescence. Parallel
   bond model, a type of bonded-particle model, was used to numerically
   simulate the cracking process in rock-like material containing a single
   flaw under uniaxial vertical compression. The single flaw's inclinations
   varied from 0A degrees to 75A degrees measured from the horizontal. As
   the uniaxial compression load was increased, multiple new microcracks
   initiated in the rock, which later propagated and eventually coalesced
   into longer macrocracks. The inclination of the pre-existing flaw was
   found to have a strong influence on the crack initiation and propagation
   patterns. The simulations replicated most of the phenomena observed in
   the physical experiments, such as the type, the initiation location and
   the initiate angle of the first cracks, as well as the development of
   hair-line cracks, which later evolved to macrocracks. Analyses of the
   parallel bond forces and displacement fields revealed some important
   mechanisms of the cracking processes. The first cracks typically
   initiated from the tensile stress concentration regions, in which the
   tensile stress was partially released after their initiation. The
   tensile stress concentration regions subsequently shifted outwards close
   to the propagating tips of the first cracks. The initiation and
   propagation of the first cracks would not significantly influence the
   compressive stress singularity at the flaw tips, which was the driving
   force of the initiation of secondary cracks. The initiation of
   microcracking zone consisting almost exclusively of micro-tensile
   cracks, and that of microcracking zone consisting of micro-tensile
   cracks and mixed micro-tensile and shear cracks, were found to be
   correlated with two distinct types of displacement fields, namely type I
   (DF\_I) and type II (DF\_II), respectively.}},

Title = {{Integrated modeling of friction stir welding of 6xxx series Al alloys:
   Process, microstructure and properties}},
Journal = {{PROGRESS IN MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{95-183}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Compared to most thermomechanical processing methods, friction stir
   welding (FSW) is a recent technique which has not yet reached full
   maturity. Nevertheless, owing to multiple intrinsic advantages, FSW has
   already replaced conventional welding methods in a variety of industrial
   applications especially for Al alloys. This provides the impetus for
   developing a methodology towards optimization, from process to
   performances, using the most advanced approach available in materials
   science and thermomechanics. The aim is to obtain a guidance both for
   process fine tuning and for alloy design. Integrated modeling
   constitutes a way to accelerate the insertion of the process, especially
   regarding difficult applications where for instance ductility, fracture
   toughness, fatigue and/or stress corrosion cracking are key issues.
   Hence, an integrated modeling framework devoted to the FSW of 6xxx
   series Al alloys has been established and applied to the 6005A and 6056
   alloys. The suite of models involves an in-process temperature evolution
   model, a microstructure evolution model with an extension to
   heterogeneous precipitation, a microstructure based strength and strain
   hardening model, and a micro-mechanics based damage model. The
   presentation of each model is supplemented by the coverage of relevant
   recent literature. The ``model chain{''} is assessed towards a wide
   range of experimental data. The final objective is to present routes for
   the optimization of the FSW process using both experiments and models.
   Now, this strategy goes well beyond the case of FSW, illustrating the
   potential of chain models to support a ``material by design approach{''}
   from process to performances. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The anisotropic ductile fracture of a 6260-T6 anisotropic aluminum alloy
   extrusion is investigated using a hybrid experimental-numerical
   approach. A basic fracture testing program covering a wide range of
   stress states and different material orientations is carried out. It
   comprises experiments on notched tensile specimens, tensile specimens
   with a central hole and butterfly shear specimens. The surface strain
   fields are obtained using two-dimensional Digital Image Correlation
   (DIC), while detailed finite element simulations are performed of all
   experiments to determine the local stress and strain histories inside
   the specimens. The analysis shows that the use of the newly-proposed
   extension of the Yld2000 yield function for three-dimensional stress
   states (see companion paper) together with an isotropic hardening law is
   able to predict the elasto-plastic behaviors of the present anisotropic
   aluminum alloy in all experiments. The experimental results show a
   strong dependency of the strain to fracture on the material orientation
   with respect to the loading direction. An uncoupled non-associated
   anisotropic fracture model is proposed which makes use of a stress state
   dependent weighting function and an anisotropic plastic strain measure.
   The latter is obtained from applying the von Mises equivalent plastic
   strain definition after the linear transformation of the plastic strain
   tensor. It is shown that the use of the isotropic Modified Mohr-Coulomb
   (MMC) stress state weighting function in this anisotropic fracture
   modeling framework provides accurate predictions of the onset of
   fracture for all thirteen fracture experiments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{When a structure is subjected to dynamic or static loads, cracks may

   shape and frequency changes of cracked structures are taken into account
   to construct a new hybrid crack detection method. The method includes
   two steps: crack localization and depth estimation. The locations of the
   cracks are determined by applying the wavelet transform to the modal
   shape. Using the measured natural frequencies as inputs, the depths of
   the cracks are estimated from a database established by wavelet finite
   element method. The effectiveness of the proposed hybrid two-step method
   is demonstrated by numerical simulation and experimental investigation
   of a cantilever beam with two cracks. Our analyses also indicate that

Abstract = {{In this contribution, a numerical assessment of three isotropic
   constitutive models is performed in order to identify their
   applicability and reliability in the prediction of ductile failure under
   a wide range of stress triaxiality. The well established isotropic
   coupled damage models proposed by Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman (GTN),
   which is based on micromechanical grounds and here extended with a shear
   mechanism, and by Lemaitre, which is based on continuum damage
   mechanics, are selected and investigated. Besides these, an uncoupled
   damage elasto-plastic model proposed by Bai and Wierzibicki, which
   includes the effect of three invariants of the stress tensor, is also
   selected and examined. All constitutive formulations are implemented in
   a quasi-static finite element scheme and applied to simulate the
   behavior of the 2024-T351 aluminum alloy, which is strongly dependent on
   both pressure and Lode angle. To assess the predictive ability of the
   constitutive models under different levels of stress triaxiality,
   specimens with different geometries and dimensions are used, such as:
   smooth and notched cylindrical bars, a plate hole specimen and a
   butterfly specimen. The evaluation of the models is initially carried
   out under pure tensile loading conditions and then under shear dominated
   deformation modes. In addition, a combination of both tensile and shear
   loading is also studied. Finally, the results obtained from the
   numerical simulations are analyzed and critically compared with
   experimental results available in the literature. The performance of
   each constitutive approach under each range of stress triaxiality is
   highlighted and the main observations are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier

   material removal in RUM of brittle materials, the cutting force model is
   developed step by step. On the basis of this mechanistic model,
   relationships between cutting force and input variables (such as spindle

Abstract = {{This article presents a methodology for damage detection, location, and
   quantification based on vibration signature analysis and a comprehensive
   experimental study to assess the utility of the proposed structural
   health monitoring applied to a five-bay truss-type structure. The MUSIC
   algorithm introduced first by Jiang and Adeli for health monitoring of
   structures in 2007 is fused with artificial neural networks for an
   automated result. The developed methodology is based on feeding the
   amplitude of the natural frequencies as input of an artificial neural
   network, being the novelty of the proposed methodology its ability to
   identify, locate, and quantify the severity of damages with precision
   such as: external and internal corrosion and cracks in an automated
   monitoring process. Results show the proposed methodology is effective
   for detecting a healthy structure, a structure with external and
   internal corrosion, and a structure with crack. Therefore, the proposed
   fusion of MUSIC-ANN algorithms can be regarded as a simple, effective,
   and automated tool without requiring sophisticated equipment, toward
   establishing a practical and reliable structural health monitoring
   methodology, which will help to evaluate the condition of the structure,

Title = {{A modified viscoplastic model to predict the permanent deformation of
   asphaltic materials under cyclic-compression loading at high
   temperatures}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{35}},
Pages = {{100-134}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{When subjected to cyclic creep (ratcheting) loading with rest periods
   between the loading cycles, the viscoplastic behavior of asphaltic
   materials changes such the rate of accumulation of the viscoplastic
   strain at the beginning of the subsequent loading cycle increases
   comparing to that at the end of the preceding loading cycle. This
   phenomenon is referred to as the hardening-relaxation (or
   viscoplastic-softening) and is a key element in predicting the permanent
   deformation (rutting) of asphalt pavements which is one of the most
   important distresses in asphalt pavements. This paper presents a
   phenomenological-based rate-dependent hardening-relaxation model to
   significantly enhance the prediction of the permanent deformation in
   asphaltic materials subjected to cyclic-compression loadings at high
   temperatures. A hardening-relaxation memory surface is defined in the
   viscoplastic strain space as the general condition for the initiation
   and evolution of the hardening-relaxation (or viscoplastic-softening).
   The memory surface is formulated to be a function of an internal state
   variable memorizing the maximum viscoplastic strain for which the
   softening has been occurred during the deformation history. The
   evolution function for the hardening-relaxation model is then defined as
   a function of the hardening-relaxation internal state variable. The
   proposed viscoplastic-softening model is coupled to the nonlinear
   Schapery's viscoelastic and Perzyna's viscoplastic models. The numerical
   algorithms for the proposed model are implemented in the well-known
   finite element code Abaqus via the user material subroutine UMAT. The
   model is then calibrated and verified by comparing the model predictions
   and experimental data that includes cyclic creep-recovery loadings at
   different stress levels, loading times, rest periods, and confinement
   levels. Model predictions show that the proposed approach provides a
   promising tool for constitutive modeling of cyclic hardening-relaxation
   in asphaltic materials and in general in time- and rate-dependent
   materials. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Acoustic emission signals originating from interlaminar crack
   propagation in fiber reinforced composites were recorded during double
   cantilever beam testing. The acoustic emission signals detected during
   testing were analyzed by feature based pattern recognition techniques.
   In previous studies it was demonstrated that the presented approach for
   detection of distinct types of acoustic emission signals is suitable.
   The subsequent correlation of distinct acoustic emission signal types to
   microscopic failure mechanisms is based on two procedures. Firstly, the
   frequency of occurrence of the distinct signal types is correlated to
   different specimens' fracture surface microstructure. Secondly, a
   comparison is made between experimental signals and signals resulting
   from finite element simulations based on a validated model for
   simulation of acoustic emission signals of typical failure mechanisms in
   fiber reinforced plastics. A distinction is made between fiber breakage,
   matrix cracking and interface failure. It is demonstrated, that the
   feature values extracted from simulated signals coincide well with those
   of experimental signals. As a result the applicability of the acoustic
   emission signal classification method for analysis of failure in carbon
   fiber and glass fiber reinforced plastics under mode-I loading
   conditions has been demonstrated. The quantification of matrix cracking,
   interfacial failure and fiber breakage was evaluated by interpretation
   of the obtained distributions of acoustic emission signals types in
   terms of fracture mechanics. The accumulated acoustic emission signal
   amplitudes show strong correlation to the mechanical properties of the
   specimens. Moreover, the changes in contribution to the different
   failure types explain the observed variation in failure behavior of the
   individual specimens quantitatively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Self-healing smart materials have emerged into the research arena and
   have been deployed in industrial and biomedical applications, in which
   the modelling techniques and predicting schemes are crucial for
   designers to optimize these smart materials. In practice, plastic
   deformation is coupled with damage and healing in these systems, which
   necessitates a coupled formulation for characterization. The
   thermodynamics of inelastic deformation, damage and healing processes
   are incorporated here to establish the coupled constitutive equations
   for healing materials. This thermodynamic consistent formulation
   provides the designers with the ability to predict the irregular
   inelastic deformation of glassy polymers and damage and healing patterns
   for a highly anisotropic self-healing system. Moreover, the lack of a
   physically consistent method to measure and calibrate the healing
   process in the literature is addressed here. Within the continuum damage
   mechanics (CDM) framework, the physics of damage and healing processes
   is used to introduce the healing effect into the CDM concept and a set
   of two new anisotropic damage-healing variables are derived. These novel
   damage-healing variables together with the proposed thermodynamic
   consistent coupled theory constitute a well-structured method for
   accurately predicting the degradation and healing mechanisms in material
   systems. The inelastic and damage response for a shape memory
   polymer-based self-healing system is captured herein. While the healing
   experimental results are limited in the literature, the proposed theory
   provides the mathematical competency to capture the most nonlinear
   responses.}},

Title = {{Experimental damage detection of cracked beams by using nonlinear
   characteristics of forced response}},

Abstract = {{Experimental evaluation of the flexural forced vibrations of a steel
   cantilever beam having a transverse surface crack extending uniformly
   along the width of the beam was performed, where an actual fatigue crack
   was introduced instead - as usual - of a narrow slot.
   The nonlinear aspects of the dynamic response of the beam under harmonic
   excitation were considered and the relevant quantitative parameters were
   evaluated, in order to relate the nonlinear resonances to the presence
   and size of the crack.
   To this end, the existence of sub- and super-harmonic components in the
   Fourier spectra of the acceleration signals was evidenced, and their
   amplitudes were quantified. In particular, the acceleration signals were
   measured in different positions along the beam axis and under different
   forcing levels at the beam tip.
   The remarkable relevance of the above mentioned nonlinear
   characteristics, and their substantial independence on force magnitude
   and measurement point were worthily noted in comparison with the
   behavior of the intact beam.
   Thus, a reliable method of damage detection was proposed which was based
   on simple tests requiring only harmonically forcing and acceleration
   measuring in any point non-necessarily near the crack
   Then, the time-history of the acceleration recorded at the beam tip was
   numerically processed in order to obtain the time-histories of velocity
   and displacement. The nonlinear features of the forced response were
   described and given a physical interpretation in order to define
   parameters suitable for damage detection. The efficiency of such
   parameters was discussed with respect to the their capability of
   detecting damage and a procedure for damage detection was proposed which
   was able to detect even small cracks by using simple instruments. A
   finite element model of the cantilever beam was finally assembled and
   tuned in order to numerically simulate the results of the experimental
   tests. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with impact damage and permanent indentation modeling.
   A numerical model has been elaborated in order to simulate the different
   impact damage types developing during low velocity/low energy impact.
   The three current damage types: matrix cracking, fiber failure and
   delamination, are simulated. Inter-laminar damage, i.e. interface
   delamination, is conventionally simulated using interface elements based
   on fracture mechanics. Intra-laminar damage, i.e. matrix cracks, is
   simulated using interface elements based on failure criterion. Fiber
   failure is simulated using degradation in the volume elements. The
   originality of this model is to simulate permanent indentation after
   impact with a ``plastic-like{''} model introduced in the matrix cracking
   elements. This model type is based on experimental observations showing
   matrix cracking debris which block crack closure. Lastly, experimental
   validation is performed, which demonstrates the model's satisfactory
   relevance in simulating impact damage. This acceptable match between
   experiment and modeling confirms the interest of the novel approach
   proposed in this paper to describe the physics behind permanent
   indentation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A micromechanical model is developed for the evaluation of creep
   deformation and rupture times of modified 9Cr-1Mo steel specimens. Creep
   deformation in metals is generally induced by the dislocation
   generation, motion, and annihilation. To evaluate the creep behavior of
   the modified 9Cr-1Mo steel the Orowan's equation was employed, which is
   valid for both glide and climb-controlled dislocation movement. The
   evolution of the dislocation density was modeled by considering the
   generation and annihilation of single and dipole dislocations. In
   addition to dislocation motion as a basis for creep deformation, there
   are several other factors which determine the creep resistance of this
   steel. Among these, the most significant are precipitate coarsening,
   solid solutions depletion, and void/crack nucleation and growth. The
   evolution of these mechanisms during creep deformation was accounted for
   by introducing specific continuum damage terms. Creep tests were also
   performed at several stress and temperature levels. The comparison of
   the numerical model results with the experimental data showed
   satisfactory agreement. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this investigation an elastic-plastic Voronoi finite element (EPVFE)
   model for rolling contact fatigue of Hertzian line contact was
   developed. The EFVFE model coupled with damage mechanics approach is
   used to investigate rolling contact fatigue (RCF) of tribo-components.
   Mises based plasticity model with kinematic hardening was employed to
   incorporate the effects of material plasticity. The model considers
   both; stress and accumulated plastic strain based damage laws in the
   constitutive damage modeling. The results indicate that once a fatigue
   crack initiates within the domain, the fatigue damage induced due to the
   accumulated plastic strains around the crack tip drives the majority of
   the crack propagation stage. The results from this investigation reveal
   that depending on the contact pressure the crack propagation stage can
   constitute 15-40\% of the total life. The spall shape, fatigue lives and
   Weibull slopes obtained from the EPVFE model correlate well with the
   experimental results. The developed model was also used to investigate
   the effects of initial material imperfections such as inclusions and
   elastic modulus inhomogeneity on the fatigue lives. The results indicate
   that material flaws within the domain lead to a significant decrease in
   fatigue lives and increase in life scatter. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Bonded fiber reinforced polymers (FRPs) reinforcement systems have
   traditionally been found to be an efficient method for improving the
   lifespan of fatigued metallic structures and have attracted much
   research attention. Nevertheless, the performance of a bonded FRP
   reinforcement system under fatigue loading is basically dependent on the
   FRP-to-metal bond behavior. In this paper, a prestressed unbonded
   reinforcement (PUR) system was developed. The proposed PUR system can be
   used as an alternative to bonded FRP reinforcement, particularly when
   there is concern about the effects of high ambient temperatures,
   moisture, water and fatigue loading on the FRP-to-metal bond behavior.
   The performance of cracked beams strengthened by the PUR system was
   compared with that of cracked beams strengthened by the prestressed
   bonded reinforcement (PBR) system. A theoretical method was developed to
   estimate the level of prestressing sufficient to arrest fatigue crack
   growth (FCG). Furthermore, the method was used to examine different
   passive, semi-active and active crack modes with a loaded, strengthened
   beam. The mechanism by which a prestressed FRP plate forms a compressive
   stress field at the vicinity of the crack tip was also examined. Finite
   element (FE) modeling was conducted and the results were compared with
   experimental results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{35}},
Pages = {{67-99}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we present within the finite element context the
   numerical algorithm for the integration of the thermodynamically
   consistent thermo-viscoelastic, thermo-viscoplastic, thermo-viscodamage,
   and thermo-healing constitutive equations derived in the first part of
   this paper. The nonlinear viscoelastic model is implemented using a
   recursive-iterative algorithm, whereas an extension of the classical
   rate-independent return mapping algorithm to the rate-dependent problems
   is used for numerical implementation of the visco-plasticity model.
   Moreover, the healing natural configuration along with the power
   transformation equivalence hypothesis, proposed in the first part of the
   paper, are used for the implementation of the viscodamage and
   micro-damage healing models. Hence, the thermo-viscoelastic and
   thermo-viscoplastic models are also implemented in the healing
   configuration. These numerical algorithms are implemented in the
   well-known finite element code Abaqus via the user material subroutine
   UMAT. A systematic procedure for identification of model parameters is
   presented. The model is then used to simulate the time-, temperature-,
   and rate-dependent response of asphalt concrete over an extensive set of
   experimental measurements including creep-recovery, creep, triaxial,
   constant strain rate, and repeated creep-recovery tests in both tension
   and compression. Comparisons of the model predictions and the
   experimental measurements show that the model is capable of predicting
   the nonlinear behavior of asphalt concrete subjected to different
   loading conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional triaxial compression and ``reducing confining pressure{''}
   experiments were carried out for red sandstone by an MTS815 Flex Test GT
   rock mechanics experimental system. Our results show that the post-peak
   axial deformation characteristics of red sandstone changed as the
   confining pressure was increased from 5 to 65 MPa. Young's modulus of
   red sandstone increased nonlinearly with increasing confining pressure,
   but Poisson's ratio remained unaffected. Using our new data, the
   compactive and dilatant behavior, strength and failure characteristics
   of sandstone under triaxial compression are further discussed. For our
   data, the nonlinear Hoek-Brown criterion better reflects the peak
   strength properties than the linear Mohr-Coulomb criterion. However, the
   residual strength shows a clear linear relationship with confining
   pressure, which can be best described using the linear Mohr-Coulomb
   criterion. The peak and residual strengths were not directly related to
   the two different loading paths. The onset of dilatancy (C'), the switch
   from compaction-dominated to dilatant-dominated behavior (D') and the
   stress at zero volumetric strain all increased linearly with the
   confining pressure. In our conventional triaxial compression
   experiments, the failure mode changed from mixed tension and shear
   fracture (single shear fracture) to shear fracture with double slippage
   planes with increasing confining pressure. However, the failure mode in
   our ``reducing confining pressure{''} experiments was more complicated
   and results mainly from the unstable failure characteristics of the rock
   during the reduction in confining pressure. Finally, based on our
   acoustic emission (AE) locations, at a confining pressure of 35 MPa, a
   detailed analysis of the evolutionary process of internal cracks is
   presented for the entire loading process.}},

Abstract = {{The size effect on the fracture process zone in notched and unnotched
   three point bending tests of concrete beams is analysed by a meso-scale

   The model parameters were chosen so that the global model response in
   the form of load-crack mouth opening displacement curves were in
   agreement with experimental results reported in the literature. The
   fracture process zone of concrete is determined numerically by
   evaluating the average of spatial distribution of dissipated energy
   densities of random meso-scale analyses. The influence of size and
   boundary conditions on the fracture process zone in concrete is
   investigated by comparing the results for beams of different sizes and

Abstract = {{Current inspection standards require an inspector to travel to a target
   structure site and visually assess the structure's condition. This
   approach is labor-intensive, yet highly qualitative. A less
   time-consuming and inexpensive alternative to current monitoring methods
   is to use a robotic system that could inspect structures more
   frequently, and perform autonomous damage detection. In this paper, a
   vision-based crack detection methodology is introduced. The proposed
   approach processes 2D digital images (image processing) by considering
   the geometry of the scene (computer vision). The crack segmentation
   parameters are adjusted automatically based on depth parameters. The
   depth perception is obtained using 3D scene reconstruction. This system
   extracts the whole crack from its background, where the regular
   edge-based approaches just segment the crack edges. This characteristic
   is appropriate for the development of a crack thickness quantification
   system. Experimental tests have been carried out to evaluate the
   performance of the proposed system. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM. All rights

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},

Volume = {{41}},
Pages = {{167-170}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports the effect of temperature on the bending properties
   and failure mechanism of a three-dimensional E-glass/epoxy
   four-directionally braided composite. Three-point bending tests of the
   composite were first performed at five different temperatures. Then the
   effect of temperature on the load/deflection curves, bending strength
   and bending stiffness were analyzed. The composite samples after the
   bending tests were also analyzed through the macro-fracture morphology
   and the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) to understand their
   deformation and failure mechanism. The results have shown that the
   temperature has significant effect on the bending properties of 3D
   braided composite and its mechanical performance decreases with the
   increase of the temperature. At the room temperature, the composite has
   the highest strength and modulus. It damages with the breaking of fibers
   and exhibits brittle fracture feature. But at the higher temperature,
   the composite becomes more softened and plastic. It damages with the
   micro-cracks of the matrix and debonding of fibers from the matrix. It
   is expected that the study can provide an experimental basis for the
   structural design of the 3D braided composites at elevated temperatures.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a pressure-dependent three-dimensional constitutive
   law to predict failure for laminated composites. The nonlinear
   constitutive response in shear and in the transverse and
   through-the-thickness directions, which is measured experimentally, is
   incorporated directly into the model. In addition, secant stiffnesses
   are dependent on the state of hydrostatic pressure and on the general
   state of strain. The failure criteria distinguish between matrix
   failure, fibre kinking and fibre tensile failure. In-situ strengths are
   used for matrix failure. Propagation of failure takes into consideration
   the fracture energy associated with each failure mode and, for matrix
   failure, the accumulation of cracks in the plies. A detailed discussion
   is undertaken of the mismatch between the available experimental data
   and the physical properties required to characterise the constitutive
   response up to final failure. The model is employed to make blind
   predictions of the triaxial failure envelopes and stress-strain curves
   of all 12 test cases provided by the organisers of the second World-Wide

Abstract = {{The characterisation of the damage state of composite structures is
   often performed using the acoustic behaviour of the composite system.
   This behaviour is expected to change significantly as the damage is
   accumulating in the composite. It is indisputable that different damage
   mechanisms are activated within the composite laminate during loading
   scenario. These ``damage entities{''} are acting in different space and
   time scales within the service life of the structure and may be
   interdependent. It has been argued that different damage mechanisms
   attribute distinct acoustic behaviour to the composite system. Loading
   of cross-ply laminates in particular leads to the accumulation of
   distinct damage mechanisms, such as matrix cracking, delamination
   between successive plies and fibre rupture at the final stage of
   loading. As highlighted in this work, the acoustic emission activity is
   directly linked to the structural health state of the laminate. At the
   same time, significant changes on the wave propagation characteristics
   are reported and correlated to damage accumulation in the composite
   laminate. In the case of cross ply laminates, experimental tests and
   numerical simulations indicate that, typical to the presence of
   transverse cracking and/or delamination, is the increase of the pulse
   velocity and the transmission efficiency of a propagated ultrasonic
   wave, an indication that the intact longitudinal plies act as wave
   guides, as the transverse ply deteriorates. Further to transverse
   cracking and delamination, the accumulation of longitudinal fibre breaks
   becomes dominant causing the catastrophic failure of the composite and
   is expected to be directly linked to the acoustic behaviour of the
   composite, as the stiffness loss results to the velocity decrease of the
   propagated wave. In view of the above, the scope of the current work is
   to assess the efficiency of acoustic emission and ultrasonic
   transmission as a combined methodology for the assessment of the
   introduced damage and furthermore as a structural health monitoring
   tool. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper illustrates an analytical approach to investigating natural
   frequencies and mode shapes of a stepped beam with an arbitrary number
   of transverse cracks and general form of boundary conditions. A new
   method to solve the inverse problem of determining the location and
   depth of multiple cracks is also presented. Based on the Euler-Bernoulli
   beam theory, the stepped cracked beam is modeled as an assembly of
   uniform sub-segments connected by massless rotational springs
   representing local flexibility induced by the non-propagating edge
   cracks. A simple transfer matrix method is utilized to obtain the
   general form of characteristic equation for the cracked beam, which is a
   function of frequency, the locations and sizes of the cracks, boundary
   conditions, geometrical and physical parameters of the beam. The
   proposed method is then used to form a system of 2N equations in order
   to identify N cracks exploiting 2N measured natural frequencies of the
   damaged beam. Various numerical examples for both direct and inverse
   problem are provided to validate the present approach. The results are
   in good agreement with those obtained by finite element and experimental
   methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A critical distance/plane method to estimate finite life of notched
   components under variable amplitude uniaxial/multiaxial fatigue loading}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{38}},
Pages = {{7-24}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The present paper summarises the main features of a design technique we
   have devised to specifically perform, by post-processing the
   linear-stress fields in the vicinity of the assumed crack initiation
   sites, the fatigue assessment of notched components subjected to
   in-service variable amplitude (VA) uniaxial/multiaxial fatigue loading.
   In more detail, fatigue damage is estimated through the Modified Miller
   Curve Method (MWCM) applied along with the Theory of Critical Distances
   (TCDs), the latter being used in the form of the Point Method (PM).
   According to the philosophy on which the linear-elastic TCD is based,
   the adopted critical distance is treated as a material property whose
   length increases as the number of cycles to failure decreases. To
   correctly apply the MWCM, the orientation of the critical plane is
   suggested here as being calculated through that direction experiencing
   the maximum variance of the resolved shear stress. Further, the above
   direction is used also to perform the cycle counting: since, by
   definition, the resolved shear stress is a monodimensional stress
   quantity, fatigue cycles are counted by taking full advantage of the
   classical three-point Rain Flow method. From a philosophical point of
   view, the real novelty contained in the present paper is that eventually
   all the different pieces of theoretical work we have done over the last
   15 years by investigating different aspects of the uniaxial/multiaxial
   fatigue issue are consistently brought together by formalising a design
   methodology of general validity. The accuracy and reliability of the
   proposed fatigue assessment technique was checked by using 124
   experimental results generated by testing notched cylindrical samples of
   carbon steel C40. The above tests were run under three different load
   spectra, by exploring uniaxial as well as in- and out-of-phase biaxial
   situations, in the latter case the axial and torsional load signals
   being not only characterised by non-zero mean values, but also by
   different frequencies. To conclude it can be said that such a systematic
   validation exercise allowed us to prove that the proposed approach is
   highly accurate, resulting in estimates falling within the constant
   amplitude (CA) fully-reversed uniaxial and torsional scatter bands used
   to calibrate the method itself (this holding true independently of both
   complexity of the applied VA loading path and sharpness of the tested
   notch). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Two noncrimp 3D woven carbon fibre composites (through thickness angle
   interlock) of binder volume fractions 3\% and 6\% were characterised for
   their response to applied deformation. Experiments were performed at
   quasi static, medium and high strain rates under a large variety of load
   cases (tension in warp/weft direction, interlaminar/intralaminar shear,
   through thickness tension/compression, 3-point bending and plate
   bending). During the study, novel experimental methods were developed in
   order to address several challenges specific to 3D composite materials.
   The results show that, while the different binder volume fractions of
   3\% and 6\% have only a small effect on the in-plane stiffness (warp and
   weft direction), its effect on the delamination resistance in plate
   bending experiments is considerable. This is a very important result for
   the use of these materials in the future. The availability, in previous
   publications, of complementary data for the matrix and the interface

Abstract = {{The estimation of a crack location and depth in a cantilever beam is
   formulated as an optimization problem and the optimal location and depth
   are found by minimizing the cost function which is based on the
   difference of the first four measured and calculated natural
   frequencies. Calculated natural frequencies are obtained using a
   rotational spring model of the crack, and measured natural frequencies
   are obtained by using cracked beam frequency response and modal
   analysis. A hybrid particle swarm-Nelder-Mead (PS-NM) algorithm is used
   for estimating the crack location and depth. The hybrid PS-NM is made-up
   of a modified particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO), aimed to
   identify the most promising areas, and a Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm
   (NM) for performing local search within these areas. The PS-NM results
   are compared with those obtained by the PSO, a hybrid
   genetic-Nelder-Mead algorithm (GA-NM) and a neural network (NN). The
   proposed PS-NM method outperforms other methods in terms of speed and
   accuracy. The average estimation errors for crack location and depth are
   (0.06\%, 0\%) for the PS-NM, however, (0.09\%, 0\%), (0.46\%, 0.54\%)
   and (0.39\%, 1.66\%) for the GA-NM, the PSO and the NN methods,
   respectively. To validate the proposed method and investigate the
   modeling and measurement errors some experimental results are also
   included. The average values of experimental location and depth
   estimation errors are (9.24\%, 8.56\%) for the PS-NM, but (9.64\%,
   9.50\%), (10.89\%, 10.89\%), (11.53\%, 11.64\%) for the GA-NM, the PSO

Abstract = {{Based on the continuum damage mechanics, a general and comprehensive

   The resulting constitutive equations are implemented in the well-known

   Finally, the model is validated by comparing the model predictions with

   creep-recovery, creep, uniaxial constant strain rate, and repeated
   creep-recovery tests in both tension and compression over a range of

Abstract = {{In practice, pavements or slabs are subjected to wide range of length
   changes during their service life. In case of cement-based materials,
   their length changes due to shrinkage and/or temperature variations
   induce tensile stress which can result in cracking detrimental for
   durability. Generally, aggravating circumstances are observed due to the
   length change restraint. This contribution focuses on experimental
   results of tests performed on rubberized concrete produced by partly
   replacing natural sand (0-4 mm) by rubber aggregates up to 40\% by
   volume. The rubber aggregates are obtained by grinding of used tyres.
   Effect of rubber aggregate on brittleness index (BI) and on damage
   evolution was investigated by conducting three-point bending tests on
   notched beam. Results of these tests confirmed that the both BI and
   damage decrease with the increase of rubber aggregate content in the
   concrete. Acoustic emission (AE) technique was applied to detect damage
   mechanism in concrete by analyzing AE parameters. The Elastic Quality
   Index (EQI) was adopted to take into account two mutually exclusive
   properties which govern the sensitivity to cracking, namely strain
   capacity and tensile strength. Results obtained from the tests performed
   at 20 degrees C, 40 degrees C and 70 degrees C showed that rubberized
   concrete exhibits EQI values within acceptable limits for the design of
   cement-based pavements. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   and slabs. The effectiveness of the recycled fibers was evaluated in
   comparison with the experimental data obtained for specimens realized
   with IFRC (Industrial Fiber Reinforced Concrete). All fresh and hardened
   proprieties of concrete mixes were experimentally estimated. The
   post-cracking behavior of the RSFRC, obtained by flexural tests, was
   comparable with that of ISFRC. RSFRC specimens showed good energy
   absorption and good residual strength after cracking.
   However, technological issues related to fibers production and concrete
   mixes preparation, must be still investigated and a wider research is
   still required to validate the interesting founds. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The recrystallization of beta-Sn profoundly affects deformation and
   failure of Sn-Ag-Cu solder joints in thermomechanical fatigue (TMF)
   testing. The numerous grain boundaries of recrystallized beta-Sn enable
   grain boundary sliding, which is absent in as-solidified solder joints.
   Fatigue cracks initiate at, and propagate along, recrystallized grain
   boundaries, eventually leading to intergranular fracture. The
   recrystallization behavior of Sn-Ag-Cu solder joints was examined in
   three different TMF conditions for five different ball grid array
   component designs. Based on the experimental observations, a TMF damage
   accumulation model is proposed: (1) strain-enhanced coarsening of
   secondary precipitates of Ag(3)Sn and Cu(6)Sn(5) starts at joint
   corners, eventually allowing recrystallization of the Sn grain there as
   well; (2) coarsening and recrystallization continue to develop into the
   interior of the joints, while fatigue crack growth lags behind; (3)
   fatigue cracks finally progress through the recrystallized region.
   Independent of the TMF condition, the recrystallization appeared to be
   essentially complete after somewhat less than 50\% of the characteristic
   life, while it took another 50\% to 75\% of the lifetime for a fatigue
   crack to propagate through the recrystallized region.}},

Abstract = {{The damage process under compressive hydrostatic stress in ductile
   metals has been observed in many experiments. However, no damage theory
   explains the physical mechanism of damage due to compressive hydrostatic
   stress in ductile metals. Recently, one possible physical mechanism of
   shear damage at low and negative stress triaxiality (The stress
   triaxiality is defined as ((1/tau(eqv))(tau(kk)/3)) where tau(eqv) =
   root(2/3)tau' : tau', tau is the Kirchhoff stress tensor. Triaxiality in
   this paper refers to the stress triaxiality defined above.) was shown to
   be the development of tensile hydrostatic stress due to grain-to-grain
   interaction (Kweon, S., Beaudoin, A.J., McDonald, R.J., 2010.
   Experimental characterization of damage processes in aluminum AA2024-O.
   Journal of Engineering Materials and Technology 132.) Kweon (2009. Edge
   cracking in rolling of an aluminum alloy AA2024-O. Mechanical Science
   and Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana.) proposed a mesoscale
   theoretical framework that can be used to quantitatively investigate the
   amount of shear damage at all triaxiality levels, incorporating the
   physical mechanism of shear damage. This theoretical framework is based
   on crystal plasticity and the theory of void growth due to hydrostatic
   stress. The damage process at negative triaxiality is particularly
   important since many industrial processes for metals involve a
   compressive hydrostatic stress state such as rolling. Using the
   mesoscale theoretical framework, damage at negative triaxiality is
   theoretically quantified. It is shown that damage does exist at small
   negative triaxiality, and that the shear deformation component drives
   damage in the small negative triaxiality regime. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A cumulative fatigue damage model is presented to estimate fatigue life
   for high-strength steels in high-cycle and very-high-cycle fatigue
   regimes with fish-eye mode failure, and a simple formula is obtained.
   The model takes into account the inclusion size, fine granular area
   (FGA) size, and tensile strength of materials. Then, the equivalent
   crack growth rate of FGA is proposed. The model is used to estimate the
   fatigue life and equivalent crack growth rate for a bearing steel
   (GCr15) of present investigation and four high-strength steels in the
   literature. The equivalent crack growth rate of FGA is calculated to be
   of the order of magnitude of 10-1410-11 m/cycle. The estimated results
   accord well with the present experimental results and prior predictions
   and experimental results in the literature. Moreover, the effect of
   inclusion size on fatigue life is discussed. It is indicated that the
   inclusion size has an important influence on the fatigue life, and the
   effect is related to the relative size of inclusion for FGA. For the
   inclusion size close to the FGA size, the former has a substantial
   effect on the fatigue life. While for the relatively large value of FGA
   size to inclusion size, it has little effect on the fatigue life.}},

Abstract = {{Drilling is the most commonly applied method for hole making of
   fiber-reinforced materials owing to the need for structure joining.
   Delamination is the most common defect during drilling because of the
   heterogeneity of both the fibers and the matrix. The delamination, in
   general, is an irregular shape and size, containing long and fine breaks
   and cracks at the exit of the drilled hole, especially in the drilling
   of carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP). On the other hand, a core-saw
   drill is designed to reduce the threat of chip removal in drilling
   composite materials. Since the thrust force of core-saw drill is
   distributed toward the periphery, the core-saw drill allows a larger
   critical thrust force than the twist drill at the onset of delamination
   when drilling composite materials. The aim of this paper is to present a
   novel approach of the equivalent delamination factor (F (ed)) to
   characterize drilling-induced delamination using a core-saw drill and
   compare it with the adjusted delamination factor (F (da)) and the
   conventional delamination factor (F (a)). The experimental results
   indicated that the F (ed) obtained is considered suitable for
   characterizing delamination at the exit of a hole after drilling CFRP.}},

Title = {{Micromechanics of brittle creep in rocks}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{AUG 25}},
Abstract = {{In the upper crust, the chemical influence of pore water promotes time
   dependent brittle deformation through sub-critical crack growth.
   Sub-critical crack growth allows rocks to deform and fail at stresses
   well below their short-term failure strength, and even at constant
   applied stress ({''}brittle creep{''}). Here we provide a
   micromechanical model describing time dependent brittle creep of
   water-saturated rocks under triaxial stress conditions. Macroscopic
   brittle creep is modeled on the basis of microcrack extension under
   compressive stresses due to sub-critical crack growth. The incremental
   strains due to the growth of cracks in compression are derived from the
   sliding wing crack model of Ashby and Sammis (1990), and the crack
   length evolution is computed from Charles' law. The macroscopic strains
   and strain rates computed from the model are non linear, and compare
   well with experimental results obtained on granite, low porosity
   sandstone and basalt rock samples. Primary creep (decelerating strain)
   corresponds to decelerating crack growth, due to an initial decrease in
   stress intensity factor with increasing crack length in compression.
   Tertiary creep (accelerating strain as failure is approached)
   corresponds to an increase in crack growth rate due to crack
   interactions. Secondary creep with apparently constant strain rate
   arises as an inflexion between those two end-member phases. The minimum
   strain rate at the inflexion point can be estimated analytically as a
   function of model parameters, effective confining pressure and
   temperature, which provides an approximate creep law for the process.
   The creep law is used to infer the long term strain rate as a function
   of depth in the upper crust due to the action of the applied stresses:
   in this way, sub-critical cracking reduces the failure stress in a
   manner equivalent to a decrease in cohesion. We also investigate the
   competition with pressure solution in porous rocks, and show that the
   transition from sub-critical cracking to pressure solution dominated
   creep occurs with increasing depth and decreasing strain rates.}},

   detection of high-frequency AE waves, and PZT accelerometric transducers
   for detection of low-frequency AE (elastic emission or ELE). Besides the
   high-frequency AEs, the emergence of low-frequency ELE just before the
   failure describes the transition from diffused microcracking to
   localized macrocracks which characterizes the failure in brittle
   materials. For all the specimens, a simultaneous analysis of magnetic
   activity was performed by a measuring device calibrated according to
   metrological requirements. In all the considered specimens, the presence
   of AE events has been always observed during the damage process, whereas
   it is very interesting to note that the EMEs were generally observed
   only in correspondence with sharp stress drops or the final collapse.
   The experimental evidence confirms AE and EME signals as collapse
   precursors in materials like concrete and rocks.}},

Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{35}},
Pages = {{183-190}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The fracturing behavior of materials can be nondestructively monitored
   by the acoustic emission (AE) technique, using sensors that detect the
   transient elastic waves after any crack propagation event. In addition
   to the information relatively to the total activity and the location of
   the cracks, certain waveform features supply detailed information on the
   type of cracking. The waveform of the emitted AE signal depends on the
   relative motion of the crack sides and therefore, it carries information
   on the mode of cracks. Therefore, AE is used for classification of the
   active cracking mode. This enables characterization of the current
   fracturing condition within the material and warning before final
   failure. Tension-related cracks, which in most materials and loading
   conditions are nucleated first, emit signals with higher frequency
   content and shorter rising time than shear cracks. However, in most
   cases wave propagation from the crack to the sensor is attenuative and
   dispersive. This results in signal distortion which is enhanced by
   geometry restrictions and material or damage-induced inhomogeneity. This
   results in strong change of the waveform shape and the calculated AE
   parameters. This effect is stronger as the propagation distance
   increases rendering crack classification troublesome for structures
   where the separation distance between sensors is long. In the present
   study, fracture experiments were conducted in cementitious specimens in
   order to investigate the influence of distance on the AE parameters as
   measured by sensors at different distances from the source. Numerical
   simulations based on the finite difference method are also used to
   enlighten the problem and expand to different material conditions. This
   is one of the first studies of wave dispersion examined not from the
   classical ultrasonics point of view of phase velocity dependence on
   frequency but from the AE view, where specific waveform parameters are
   of interest. Experimental and numerical results show that the influence
   of the propagation path is crucial and should be taken into
   consideration for AE characterization of large structures, while it
   should not be neglected even in small-scale laboratory studies in order
   to improve crack characterization. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this study, the influence of varying impactor geometries on the
   impact damage characteristics of hemp fibre reinforced unsaturated
   polyester composites were subjected to a low-velocity impact loading
   using an instrumented falling weight impact test setup. The three
   varying tup geometries: hemispherical, 30 degrees and 90 degrees, at
   four different impact velocity levels: 2.52 m/s, 2.71 m/s, 2.89 m/s and
   2.97 m/s were assessed. The experimental results to investigate the
   influence of impactor geometry suggest that HFRUP composites were able
   to withstand higher loads when tested with hemispherical impactor and
   also absorbed more energy than that for 90 degrees and 30 degrees shaped
   tup geometry. The post impact damage patterns and failure mechanisms of
   impacted samples were further characterised by ultrasonic (UT)
   inspection. Impact induced damage characterised by scanning electron
   microscope (SEM) suggests that damage induced by the impact included a
   typical failure mechanisms showing matrix cracking, fibre breakage and
   fibre pullout. As the impact velocity increases the damage to back face
   of the laminate increased for laminates tested with a hemispherical
   impactor while it decreased to certain extent for laminates tested with
   90 degrees and 30 degrees impactor geometries. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental study into a new type of stitched
   fibre-polymer laminate that combines high interlaminar toughness with
   self-healing repair of delamination damage. Poly(ethylene-co-methacrylic
   acid) (EMAA) filaments were stitched into carbon fibre/epoxy laminate to
   create a three-dimensional self-healing fibre system that also provides
   high fracture toughness. Double cantilever beam testing revealed that
   the stitched EMAA fibres increased the mode I interlaminar fracture
   toughness (by similar to 120\%) of the laminate, and this reduced the
   amount of delamination damage that must subsequently be repaired by the
   self-healing stitches. The 3D stitched network was effective in
   delivering self-healing EMAA material extracted from the stitches into
   the damaged region, and this resulted in high recovery in the
   delamination fracture toughness (similar to 150\% compared to the
   original material). The new self-healing stitching method provides high
   toughness which resists delamination growth while also having the
   functionality to repeatedly repair multiple layers of damage in epoxy
   matrix laminates. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Effect of salt crystallisation on the shear behaviour of masonry walls:
   An experimental study}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},

Volume = {{37}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Salt weathering is one of the most common deterioration mechanisms in
   porous materials and may lead to severe damage in buildings and
   artworks. In last decades, a lot of research has been devoted to explain
   the mechanisms of crystal growth and crystallisation pressure inside
   pores and their relation with crack propagation in materials such as
   natural stone, brick, mortar and concrete. However, the effect of salts
   on the structural behaviour of masonry has not been fully elucidated.
   This paper presents a preliminary experimental study conducted on
   masonry specimens made of fired-clay bricks and cement mortar joints in
   order to assess the structural damage induced by salts. To this aim, the
   specimens were subjected to purposely-designed accelerated weathering
   procedures of different duration in sodium chloride and sodium sulphate
   solutions (the most common salts in brick masonries). Then, the shear
   behaviour of the artificially damaged masonry specimens was investigated
   by means of an ad hoc experimental test. As well known, the shear
   behaviour of masonry buildings plays a crucial role for structures
   located in areas prone to seismic hazard.
   The main mechanical parameters that result from the analysis of the
   pre-peak behaviour of the specimens, such as initial stiffness and peak
   load, have been correlated to the main material microstructural
   parameters (total porosity and pore size distribution) and to salt
   amount. It has been observed that the presence of salt affects the
   structural behaviour of masonry depending on the type of salt and on the
   duration of the weathering cycles. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This work presents a numerical analysis of damage of composite materials
   with polymeric matrix reinforced with carbon fibres subject to static
   tension. Verification of numerical analyses was conducted with
   experimental methods - strength tests and microstructural observations.
   The methodologies applied were: the material damage modelling
   methodology based on XFEM (eXtended Finite Element Method) and contact
   interactions in a fibre-matrix connection layer using the CZM method
   (Cohesive Zone Method - Surface-based Cohesive Behaviour).
   ABAQUS/Standard software was the applied numerical tool. Microstructural
   analysis and numerical simulations indicate the fact that initiation of
   composite material damage takes place at the interface as a result of
   cracking and loss of fibre/matrix connection. This results in weakening
   of the composite microstructure in this area through the initiation of a
   reinforcement cracking process, which leads to further structural
   degradation, consisting in propagation of matrix cracking and, as a
   result, complete damage of the composite structure. The presented
   research of carbon/epoxy composite damage confirmed the adequacy of the
   prepared numerical model. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},
