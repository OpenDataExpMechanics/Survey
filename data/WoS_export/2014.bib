Title = {{Damage identification for beams in noisy conditions based on Teager

Abstract = {{Modal curvatures have been widely used in the detection of structural
   damage. Attractive features of modal curvature include great sensitivity
   to damage and instant determination of damage location. However, an
   intrinsic deficiency in a modal curvature is its susceptibility to the
   measurement noise present in the displacement mode shape that produces
   the modal curvature, likely obscuring the features of damage. To address
   this deficiency, the Teager energy operator together with wavelet
   transform is tactically utilized to treat modal curvature, producing a
   new modal curvature, termed the Teager energy operator-wavelet transform
   modal curvature. This new modal curvature features distinct capabilities
   of suppressing noise, canceling global trends, and intensifying the
   singular feature caused by damage for a measured mode shape involving
   noise. These features maximize the sensitivity to damage and accuracy of
   damage localization. The proposed modal curvature is demonstrated in
   several analytical cases of cracked pinned-pinned, clamped-free and
   clamped-clamped beams, with emphasis on characterizing damage in noisy
   conditions, and it is further validated by an experimental program using
   a scanning laser vibrometer to acquire mode shapes of a cracked aluminum
   beam. The Teager energy operator-wavelet transform modal curvature
   essentially overcomes the deficiency of conventional modal curvature,
   providing a new dynamic feature well suited for damage characterization
   in noisy environments. (The Matlab code for implementing Teager energy
   operator-wavelet transform modal curvature can be provided by the

Abstract = {{The scales of the arapaima (Arapaima gigas), one of the largest
   freshwater fish in the world, can serve as inspiration for the design of
   flexible dermal armor. Each scale is composed of two layers: a laminate
   composite of parallel collagen fibrils and a hard, highly mineralized
   surface layer. We review the structure of the arapaima scales and
   examine the functions of the different layers, focusing on the
   mechanical behavior, including tension and penetration of the scales,
   with and without the highly mineralized outer layer. We show that the
   fracture of the mineral and the stretching, rotation and delamination of
   collagen fibrils dissipate a significant amount of energy prior to
   catastrophic failure, providing high toughness and resistance to
   penetration by predator teeth. We show that the arapaima's scale has
   evolved to minimize damage from penetration by predator teeth through a
   Bouligand-like arrangement of successive layers, each consisting of
   parallel collagen fibrils with different orientations. This inhibits
   crack propagation and restricts damage to an area adjoining the
   penetration. The flexibility of the lamellae is instrumental to the
   redistribution of the compressive stresses in the underlying tissue,
   decreasing the severity of the concentrated load produced by the action
   of a tooth. The experimental results, combined with small-angle Xray
   scattering characterization and molecular dynamics simulations, provide
   a complete picture of the mechanisms of deformation, delamination and
   rotation of the lamellae during tensile extension of the scale. (C) 2014

Title = {{An extended GTN model for ductile fracture under high and low stress
   triaxiality}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{54}},
Pages = {{193-228}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This contribution provides an improvement on GTN model upon the
   prediction of fracture location within low level of stress triaxiality.
   In the proposition, two distinct damage parameters are introduced as
   internal variables of the degradation process and an effective damage is
   calculated as a sum of both contributions in the post-processed step. In
   the beginning, the volume void fraction, based on conservation mass law,
   is assumed as the first damage parameter, similar to Gurson's original
   model. This volumetric damage contribution is able to capture spherical
   void growth, which plays the main role in tensile loading condition. The
   second damage parameter is proposed as a new shear mechanism, based on
   geometrical and phenomenological aspects and is also a function of the
   equivalent plastic strain, Lode angle and stress triaxiality. The shear
   damage parameter is formulated independent of the volume void fraction
   and requires a new nucleation of micro-defects mechanism to trigger the
   shear growth contribution, and hence is able to capture elongated (and
   rotation) void growth which is present in simple shear and combined
   shear/tensile or shear/compression loading conditions. Furthermore, the
   first and the second damage parameters are coupled in the yield function
   in order to affect the hydrostatic stress and deviatoric stress
   contributions, separately. In the first part of this paper, a review of
   Gurson's model and its most famous version as GTN's model is done. After
   that, the new contribution is presented and an implicit numerical
   integration algorithm is determined, based on the operator split
   methodology. The calibration strategy is discussed for determination of
   material parameters. Numerical tests are performed for a butterfly
   specimen using two types of materials (aluminum alloy 2024-T351 and
   steel 1045) under ranges of stress triaxiality between-1/3 < eta < 1/3
   (shear/compression or shear/tensile). At the end, the behavior of
   internal variables is analyzed, such as: evolution of both damage
   parameters, evolution of the equivalent plastic strain, the reaction
   curve and the contour of the effective damage parameter. The results
   obtained are compared with experimental data and have shown that the
   present formulation performs well in the prediction of the fracture
   location and determination of the correct level of equivalent plastic
   strain at fracture under predominant shear loading condition. (C) 2013

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{199-212}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{A continuum damage mechanics (CDM) based constitutive model has been
   developed to describe elastic, plastic and damage behavior of porous
   rocks. The pressure sensitive inelastic deformation of porous rocks
   together with their damage mechanisms are studied for drained and
   undrained conditions. Fracture mechanics of microcrack and micro-void
   nucleation and their coalescence are incorporated into the formulation
   of the CDM models to accurately capture different failure modes of
   rocks. A fracture mechanics based failure criterion is also incorporated
   to accurately capture the post fracture crack advances in the case of
   progressive failures. The performance of the developed elastoplastic and
   CDM models are compared with the available experimental data and then
   the models are introduced into a commercial software package through
   user-defined subroutines. The hydraulic fractures growth in a reservoir
   rock is then investigated; in which the effect of injection pressure is
   studied and the simulations are compared with the available solutions in
   the literature. The developed CDM model outperforms the traditional
   fracture mechanics approaches by removing stress singularities at the
   fracture tips and simulation of progressive fractures without any
   essential need for remeshing. This model would provide a robust tool for
   modeling hydraulic fracture growth using conventional elements of FEA
   with a computational cost less than similar computational techniques
   like cohesive element methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENDODONTICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The aim of the present study was to investigate the
   incidence of cracks in root dentin after root canal preparation with
   ProTaper Next (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland), HyFlex
   (Coltene-Whaledent, Allstetten, Switzerland), and ProTaper Universal
   (Dentsply Maillefer) rotary instruments. Methods: One-hundred mandibular
   premolars were selected. Twenty-five teeth were left unprepared and
   served as a negative control; another 25 teeth were in-strumented with
   the ProTaper Universal system up to size F4 as a positive control, and
   the remaining 50 teeth were shaped with the following experimental
   groups with an apical size 40 file: ProTaper Next X4 and HyFlex 40/0.4.
   After root canal preparation, all of the roots were sectioned
   perpendicular to the long axis at 2, 4, 6, and 8 mm from the apex, and
   the sections were then observed under a stereomicroscope. The
   absence/presence of cracks was recorded, and the data were analyzed with
   a chi-square test. The significance level was set at P = .05. Results:
   No cracks were observed in the negative control group. Vertical root
   fractures were not observed in any of the groups. The ProTaper Next and
   HyFlex instruments caused fewer cracks (28\%) than the ProTaper
   Universal instrument (56\%) (P < .05). However, there were no
   significant differences in crack formation between the ProTaper Next and
   HyFlex groups (P > .05). Conclusions: Within the limitations of this in
   vitro study, all of the instrumentation systems used in this study
   created cracks in the root dentin. The ProTaper Next and HyFlex
   instruments tended to cause fewer dentinal cracks compared with the
   ProTaper Universal instrument.}},

Abstract = {{Fracture in metal forming can occur in three different modes: (i)
   tensile; (ii) in-plane shear; and (iii) out-of-plane shear (respectively
   the same as modes 1, II and III of fracture mechanics). The
   circumstances under which each mode will occur are identified in terms
   of plastic flow and microstructural ductile damage by means of an
   analytical framework to characterize fracture loci under plane stress
   conditions that also takes anisotropy into consideration.
   Experimental results retrieved from the literature give support to the
   presentation and show that plastic flow and failure in sheet forming
   results from competition between modes I and II whereas in bulk forming
   fracture results from competition between modes I and III. (C) 2014

Journal = {{COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{121-132}},
Month = {{SEP 12}},
Abstract = {{Thin-ply composites are rapidly gaining interest in the composite
   industry, not only because of the larger design possibilities that they
   offer, but also because of positive size effects that have been shown to
   improve performance in various loading conditions {[}1]. In this work,
   carbon fiber-epoxy composites of different ply thicknesses (30-300
   g/m(2) fiber areal weight) were produced from the same batch of Toray
   M40JB fiber and NorthTPT TP80ep matrix to study the influence of ply
   thickness on the ultimate strength and on the onset of damage in lamina,
   laminates and components. Uniaxial tension, open-hole compression and
   open-hole tensile fatigue tests on quasi isotropic {[}45 degrees/90
   degrees/-45 degrees/0 degrees](ns) laminates showed very significant
   improvements regarding the on-set of damage, and in some cases ultimate
   strength, when decreasing the ply thickness. These performance
   improvements are the result of major changes in the damage progression
   and failure modes of the laminates caused by a systematic delay or near
   suppression of transverse cracking and delamination growth in thin-ply
   composites. On the component level, thin-ply laminates enabled a marked
   improvement for bolted-joint bearing, especially in hot-wet conditions.
   Under impact, the 30 mu m thin ply laminate exhibited a quasi-brittle
   failure with extensive translaminar cracking while a ply thickness of
   100 mu m was found as optimum to minimize the projected damage area. Ply
   thickness scaling of transverse and in-plane shear strength was
   identified based on classical laminate theory and unnotched tensile
   tests on quasi-isotropic specimens. The empirical scaling was found to
   follow a linear trend over a range of ply thicknesses from 30 to 250 mu
   m. Due to the near suppression of delamination, the strength of thin-ply
   composites could then be modeled more effectively than thick ply
   composites using classical laminate theory or standard multilayer shell
   modeling. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Subsurface damages and surface roughness are the two significant
   parameters which determine the efficiency of optical components. In this
   study, a cup diamond wheel is used in grinding process of the specimens
   made of Zerodur (R) glass-ceramic, to investigate the influences of
   grinding parameters on the SSD and SR. The grinding parameters used in
   this study are depth of cut, cutting speed and feed rate; and effects of
   these parameters are studied. The experimental results are compared with
   the modified model of Lambropoulos, proposed by Li, and a good
   accordance is observed between them. Two measuring techniques were used
   to study the SSD. Cross-sectional polishing method and angle polishing
   method; the first one, suitable for studying the material removal
   mechanism and the other one convenient for examining the depth of
   subsurface damages and distribution of micro-cracks in the ground
   surface, respectively. A novel technique is introduced to measure the
   cracks length in which the sum of all cracks in a specific area of a SEM
   micrograph is calculated by image processing method and regarded as a
   factor to study the cracks length. Also, a statistical model is
   developed in order to predict the surface roughness and a good agreement
   is observed between the experimental results and the predicted values.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NONDESTRUCTIVE EVALUATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{Guided wave imaging with a distributed array of inexpensive transducers
   offers a fast and cost-efficient means for damage detection and
   localization in plate-like structures such as aircraft and spacecraft
   skins. As such, this technology is a natural choice for inclusion in
   condition-based maintenance and integrated structural health management
   programs. One of the implementation challenges results from the complex
   interaction of propagating ultrasonic waves with both the interrogation
   structure and potential defects or damage. For example, a guided
   ultrasonic wave interacts with a surface or sub-surface defect
   differently depending on the angle of incidence, defect size and
   orientation, excitation frequency, and guided wave mode. However, this
   complex interaction also provides a mechanism for guided wave imaging
   algorithms to perform damage characterization in addition to damage
   detection and localization. Damage characterization provides a mechanism
   to help discriminate actual damage (e.g. fatigue cracks) from benign
   changes, and can be used with crack propagation models to estimate
   remaining life. This work proposes the use of minimum variance imaging
   to perform damage detection, localization, and characterization.
   Scattering assumptions used to perform damage characterization are
   obtained through both analytical and finite element models. Experimental
   data from an in situ distributed array are used to demonstrate
   feasibility of this approach using a through-hole and two
   through-thickness notches of different orientations to simulate damage
   in an aluminum plate.}},

Abstract = {{A fretting fatigue failure scenario can be explained by accumulation of
   damage, which leads to formation of initial macro-cracks at the contact
   interface and propagation of macro-cracks to sudden rupture of bulk
   material. The main aim of this study is estimating these two portions by
   means of a numerical modelling approach. For this purpose, an uncoupled
   damage model based on a thermodynamic potential function is used to
   model the crack initiation lifetime. In order to model crack propagation
   part a linear-elastic fracture mechanics approach under mixed-mode
   loading conditions has been considered. The crack propagation direction
   is defined based on experimental observation and compared with some
   available criteria in the literature, which are usually used for
   proportional loading conditions. The estimated results are compared with
   observed experimental lifetime and show good agreement. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{A dedicated modeling technique for comprehending nonlinear
   characteristics of ultrasonic waves traversing in a fatigued medium was
   developed, based on a retrofitted constitutive relation of the medium by
   considering the nonlinearities originated from material, fatigue damage,
   as well as the ``breathing'' motion of fatigue cracks. Piezoelectric
   wafers, for exciting and acquiring ultrasonic waves, were integrated in
   the model. The extracted nonlinearities were calibrated by virtue of an
   acoustic nonlinearity parameter. The modeling technique was validated
   experimentally, and the results showed satisfactory consistency in
   between, both revealing: the developed modeling approach is able to
   faithfully simulate fatigue crack-incurred nonlinearities manifested in
   ultrasonic waves; a cumulative growth of the acoustic nonlinearity
   parameter with increasing wave propagation distance exists; such a
   parameter acquired via a sensing path is nonlinearly related to the
   offset distance from the fatigue crack to that sensing path; and neither
   the incidence angle of the probing wave nor the length of the sensing
   path impacts on the parameter significantly. This study has yielded a
   quantitative characterization strategy for fatigue cracks using
   embeddable piezoelectric sensor networks, facilitating deployment of
   structural health monitoring which is capable of identifying small-scale
   damage at an embryo stage and surveilling its growth continuously. (C)

Abstract = {{Short and long term trends in creep crack growth (CCG) rate data over
   test times of 500-30 000 h are available for Austenitic Type 316H
   stainless steel at 550 degrees C using compact tension, C(T), specimens.
   The relationship between CCG rate and its dependence on creep ductility,
   strain rate and plastic strain levels has been examined. Uniaxial creep
   data from a number of batches of 316H stainless steel, over the
   temperature range 550-750 degrees C, have been collected and analysed.
   Power-law correlations have been determined between the creep ductility,
   creep rupture times and average creep strain rate data with stress sigma
   normalised by flow stress sigma(0.2) over the range
   0.2<sigma/sigma(0.2)<3 for uniaxial creep tests times between 100 and
   100 000 h. Creep ductility exhibits upper shelf and lower shelf values
   which are joined by a stress dependent transition region. The creep
   strain rate and creep rupture exponents have been correlated with stress
   using a two-stage power-law fit over the stress range
   0.2<sigma/sigma(0.2)<3 for temperatures between 550 and 750 degrees C,
   where it is known that power-law creep dominates. For temperature and
   stress ranges where no data are currently available, the data trend
   lines have been extrapolated to provide predictions over the full stress
   range. A stress dependent creep ductility and strain rate model has been
   implemented in a ductility exhaustion constraint based damage model
   using finite element (FE) analysis to predict CCG rates in 316H
   stainless steel at 550 degrees C. The predicted CCG results are compared
   to analytical constant creep ductility CCG models (termed NSW models),
   assuming both plane stress and plane strain conditions, and validated
   against long and short term CCG test data at 550 degrees C. Good
   agreement has been found between the FE predicted CCG trends and the
   available experimental data over a wide stress range although it has
   been shown that upper-bound NSW plane strain predictions for long term
   tests are overly conservative.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECCs) are structural materials known
   for their excellent tensile ductility and damage tolerance. Previous
   experimental studies have shown a strong dependence of electrical
   resistivity of ECC on applied mechanical tensile strain (piezoresistive
   behavior), which can be potentially utilized for self-sensing mechanical
   damage for structural health monitoring. In this paper, the influence of
   micro-cracks on the composite electrical response of ECC under direct
   tension is investigated experimentally as well as analytically. For this
   purpose, the electrical-mechanical properties of two ECCs with different
   crack patterns are compared at macro (composite) and meso (single-crack)
   scales. An analytical model linking single-crack electrical response and
   crack pattern of an ECC to its composite electrical behavior is proposed
   in this study, and verified for both ECCs with experimental
   observations. Thus, a fundamental understanding of crack patterns and
   their effects on piezoresistivity of ECC is developed in this study. (C)

Abstract = {{A novel method is proposed for calculating the natural frequencies of a
   multiple cracked beam and detecting unknown number of multiple cracks
   from the measured natural frequencies. First, an explicit expression of
   the natural frequencies through crack parameters is derived as a
   modification of the Rayleigh quotient for the multiple cracked beams
   that differ from the earlier ones by including nonlinear terms with
   respect to crack severity. This expression provides a simple tool for
   calculating the natural frequencies of the beam with arbitrary number of
   cracks instead of solving the complicated characteristic equation. The
   obtained nonlinear expression for natural frequencies in combination
   with the so-called crack scanning method proposed recently by the
   authors allowed the development of a novel procedure for consistent
   identification of unknown amount of cracks in the beam with a limited
   number of measured natural frequencies. The developed theory has been
   illustrated and validated by both numerical and experimental results.

Abstract = {{In the present work a criterion for the non-fibre (i.e. matrix or
   fibre-matrix interface) - controlled fatigue behaviour of composite
   unidirectional laminae subjected to multiaxial loading is proposed. The
   criterion is based on experimental observations of the damage modes
   occurring at the microscopic scale leading to the fatigue failure of a
   lamina. In particular two parameters have been identified as
   representative of the driving forces for the damage initiation, and they
   have to be used for design purposes depending on the local multiaxial
   condition. These parameters, i.e. the local maximum principal stress and
   local hydrostatic stress, are calculated from the local stresses in the
   matrix, obtained from Finite Element analyses of a fibre/matrix unit
   cell subjected to periodic boundary conditions. The application of the
   proposed criterion to fatigue data taken from the literature shows that
   only two scatter bands can be used to completely describe the fatigue
   response of unidirectional laminae under generic multiaxial stress

Journal = {{ULTRASONICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{663-675}},

Abstract = {{Cutting force is one of the most important output variables in rotary
   ultrasonic machining (RUM) of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP)
   composites. Many experimental investigations on cutting force in RUM of
   CFRP have been reported. However, in the literature, there are no
   cutting force models for RUM of CFRP. This paper develops a mechanistic
   predictive model for cutting force in RUM of CFRP. The material removal
   mechanism of CFRP in RUM has been analyzed first. The model is based on
   the assumption that brittle fracture is the dominant mode of material
   removal. CFRP micromechanical analysis has been conducted to represent
   CFRP as an equivalent homogeneous material to obtain the mechanical
   properties of CFRP from its components. Based on this model,
   relationships between input variables (including ultrasonic vibration
   amplitude, tool rotation speed, feedrate, abrasive size, and abrasive
   concentration) and cutting force can be predicted. The relationships
   between input variables and important intermediate variables
   (indentation depth, effective contact time, and maximum impact force of
   single abrasive grain) have been investigated to explain predicted
   trends of cutting force. Experiments are conducted to verify the model,
   and experimental results agree well with predicted trends from this
   model. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   loading}},
Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the effect of grain boundary inclination with respect to
   the loading direction on void nucleation at a boundary, using plate
   impact experiments on polycrystalline copper. Examination of damaged
   specimens reveals that boundaries perpendicular to the loading direction
   are an order of magnitude more susceptible to failure than those
   parallel to the loading direction. We investigate the mechanisms and
   reasons behind this experimental observation through molecular dynamics
   (MD) simulations, as a function of loading direction, in a copper
   bicrystal. Two extremes of loading directions are considered, either
   parallel or perpendicular to the grain boundary plane, spanning the
   range that grain boundaries within a polycrystalline sample will
   ordinarily experience under uniaxial strain conditions. Using MD
   simulations, we demonstrate that, during shock compression, the ability
   of a boundary to undergo plastic deformation is altered measurably by
   changing the loading direction with respect to the boundary plane. This
   change in the plastic response of the GB affects the development of
   stress concentrations believed to be responsible for void nucleation. MD
   simulations show that boundaries perpendicular to the loading direction
   do not undergo as much plastic deformation, by dislocation emission, as
   those parallel to the loading direction. The lack of plastic deformation
   at the GB, in the perpendicular loading case, can decrease the stress
   required for void nucleation. The MD results are consistent with
   experimental observations, and support the contention that plastic
   response of a grain boundary under shock compression can be a
   contributing, or even dominating, factor in determining the stress for
   void nucleation. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The Opalinus Clay (OPA) is an argillaceous rock formation selected to
   host a deep geologic repository for high-level nuclear waste in
   Switzerland. It has been shown that the excavation damaged zone (EDZ) in
   this formation is heavily affected by the anisotropic mechanical
   response of the material related to the presence of bedding planes. In
   this context, the purpose of this study is twofold: (i) to illustrate
   the new developments that have been introduced into the combined
   finite-discrete element method (FEM/DEM) to model layered materials and
   (ii) to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new modelling approach in
   simulating the short-term mechanical response of OPA at the
   laboratory-scale. A transversely isotropic elastic constitutive law is
   implemented to account for the anisotropic elastic modulus, while a
   procedure to incorporate a distribution of preferentially oriented
   defects is devised to capture the anisotropic strength. Laboratory
   results of indirect tensile tests and uniaxial compression tests are
   used to calibrate the numerical model. Emergent strength and deformation
   properties, together with the simulated damage mechanisms, are shown to
   be in strong agreement with experimental observations. Subsequently, the
   calibrated model is validated by investigating the effect of confinement
   and the influence of the loading angle with respect to the specimen
   anisotropy. Simulated fracture patterns are discussed in the context of
   the theory of brittle rock failure and analyzed with reference to the
   EDZ formation mechanisms observed at the Mont Terri Underground Research

Abstract = {{A critical plane-based high-cycle multiaxial fatigue criterion, known as
   the Carpinteri-Spagnoli (C-S) criterion, is here extended to evaluate
   the fatigue lifetime of plain metallic components under constant
   amplitude loading in the low/medium-cycle regime. This extended
   criterion, based on strain components, resolves the strain tensor into
   the normal and shear components acting on the critical plane, which is
   determined on the basis of the principal strain courses over the loading
   cycle. An equivalent normal strain amplitude, computed through a
   quadratic combinations of strain components in the critical plane, is
   taken as the fatigue damage parameter. The required input parameters of
   the criterion are obtained from the classical Manson-Coffin-Basquin law
   for axial loading. A validation by experimental data pertaining the
   biaxial fatigue of plain steel specimens under both proportional and
   non-proportional loadings is performed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{An experimental procedure to estimate damage evolution and remaining
   fatigue life of metals associated with fatigue loading is presented.
   Experimental phase involves uniaxial tension-compression fatigue tests
   performed with solid API 5L X52 and tubular carbon steel 1018 specimens
   subjected to both constant and variable amplitude loading. A correlation
   between the so-called damage parameter and the thermal response of a
   material at different damage levels is proposed. Results demonstrate
   that the correlation can estimate damage evolution with reasonable
   accuracy in both constant and variable amplitude fatigue processes. It
   is shown that under the conditions tested the evolution of damage
   parameter with respect to the normalized fatigue life is independent of
   the load amplitude, load ratio, loading sequence, material properties,
   and specimen geometry. The proposed correlation and the relationship
   between the damage parameter and the normalized fatigue life are
   employed to develop a non-destructive method to predict the remaining
   fatigue life of metallic specimens with prior fatigue damage. The method
   is applied to both constant and variable amplitude loading and the
   predicted results are found to be in good agreement with those obtained
   from the experiments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mode shapes (MSs) have been extensively used to detect structural
   damage. This paper presents two new non-model-based methods that use
   measured MSs to identify embedded horizontal cracks in beams. The
   proposed methods do not require any a priori information of associated
   undamaged beams, if the beams are geometrically smooth and made of
   materials that have no stiffness discontinuities. Curvatures and
   continuous wavelet transforms (CWTs) of differences between a measured
   MS of a damaged beam and that from a polynomial that fits the MS of the
   damaged beam are processed to yield a curvature damage index (CDI) and a
   CWT damage index (CWTDI), respectively, at each measurement point. It is
   shown that the MS from the polynomial fit can well approximate the
   measured MS and associated curvature MS of the undamaged beam, provided
   that the measured MS of the damaged beam is extended beyond boundaries
   of the beam and the order of the polynomial is properly chosen. The
   proposed CDIs of a measured MS are presented with multiple resolutions
   to alleviate adverse effects caused by measurement noise, and cracks can
   be identified by locating their tips near regions with high values of
   the CDIs. It is shown that the CWT of a measured MS with the n-th-order
   Gaussian wavelet function has a shape resembling that of the n-th-order
   derivative of the MS. The crack tips can also be located using the CWTs
   of the aforementioned MS differences with second- and third-order
   Gaussian wavelet functions near peaks and valleys of the resulting
   CWTDIs, respectively, which are presented with multiple scales. A
   uniform acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) cantilever beam with an
   embedded horizontal crack was constructed to experimentally validate the
   proposed methods. The elastic modulus of the ABS was determined using
   experimental modal analysis and model updating. Non-contact operational
   modal analysis using acoustic excitations and measurements by two laser
   vibrometers was performed to measure the natural frequencies and MSs of
   the ABS cantilever beam, and the results compare well with those from
   the finite element method. Numerical and experimental crack
   identification can successfully identify the crack by locating its tips.

   chosen in order to obtain local multiaxial stress states in the off-axis

Abstract = {{Deformation and fracture behavior of Dual Phase (DP) high strength steel
   were investigated by means of a microstructure based Finite Element (FE)
   modeling. Representative Volume Elements (RVEs) were applied to consider
   effects of various microstructure constituents and characteristics.
   Individual stress-strain curves were provided for ferrite, martensite as
   well as transformation induced Geometrically Necessary Dislocations
   (GNDs) taking into account in the RVEs. Principally, the GNDs occurred
   around phase boundaries during quenching process due to the
   austenite-martensite transformation. Flow behaviors of individual phases
   were defined on the basis of dislocation theory and partitioning of
   local chemical composition. Then, flow curves of the examined DP steel
   were predicted. Furthermore, the Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman (GTN) model
   was used to represent ductile damage evolution in the microstructure.
   Occurrences of void initiation were characterized and damage parameters
   for RVE simulations were hence identified. Finally, influences of the
   GNDs, local stress and strain distributions and interactions between
   phases on predicted crack initiation in the DP microstructure were
   discussed and correlated with experimental results. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{1-15}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{For sustainability considerations, the use of recycled aggregate in
   concrete has attracted many interests in the research community. One of
   the main concerns for using such concrete in buildings is its spalling
   in fire. This may be alleviated by adding steel fibers to form steel
   fiber reinforced recycled aggreeate concrete (SFRAC). This paper
   presents an experimental investigation into the compressive properties
   of SFRAC cylinders after exposure to elevated temperatures, including
   the compressive strength, Young's modulus (stiffness), stress-strain
   curve and energy absorption capacity (toughness). The effects of two
   parameters, namely steel fiber volume content (0\%, 0.5\%, 1\%, 1.5\%)
   and temperature (room temperature, 200 degrees C, 400 degrees C and 600
   degrees C) on the compressive mechanical properties of concrete were
   investigated. The test results show that both compressive strength and
   stiffness of the concrete are significantly reduced after exposure to
   high temperatures. The addition of steel fibers is helpful in preventing
   spalling, and significantly improves the ductility and the cracking
   behavior of recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) after exposure to high
   temperatures, which is favorable for the application of RAC in building
   construction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Solder joints are generally regarded as the weakest part in packaging
   systems and electronic assemblies in modern electronic products and
   devices. In this study, both experimental and finite element methods
   were used to characterize the mechanical behavior of micro-scale
   Ni/Sn3.0Ag0.5Cu/Ni sandwich-structured joints with different
   thickness-to-diameter ratios (R varying from 1/3 to 1/12) under
   quasi-static tension loading using a dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA).
   Experimental results show that crack initiation and propagation in the
   solder matrix occur in a typical ductile manner. Compared with
   Cu/Sn3.0Ag0.5Cu/Cu sandwich-structured solder joints, Ni/Sn3.0Ag0.5Cu/Ni
   solder joints have much higher tensile strengths due to the dispersion
   strengthening effect through the fine Ag3Sn particles. With decreasing
   R, both stiffness and tensile strength of solder joints increase
   obviously with decreasing coefficient of stress state and damage
   equivalent stress. Moreover, results of quantitative fractographic
   analysis by SEM and EDS display three fracture modes with decreasing R.
   Joints with R >= 1/4 all fail by ductile fracture, those with R=1/6 fail
   by either ductile fracture or mixed ductile and brittle fractures, and
   for joints with R=1/12, brittle fracture is dominant. Furthermore,
   results obtained have also shown that the crack growth driving forces,
   K-I and K-II as well as the strain energy release rate, G(I), in the
   Ni3Sn4 layer and at the Ni3Sn4/Ni interface, increase significantly with
   decreasing R. Hence, under tensile loading the fracture mode of solder
   joints changes from ductile to brittle as R is decreased. (C) 2014

   developed. Based on the damage mechanism of fiber slipping relative to
   matrix under fatigue loading, the unloading interface counter-slip
   length and reloading interface new slip length are determined by
   fracture mechanics approach. The interface shear stress and broken
   fibers fraction corresponding to different cycles are obtained through
   comparing the experimental fatigue hysteresis loss energy with
   theoretical computational value considering fiber failure. The fatigue
   hysteresis loops of unidirectional C/SiC composite have been predicted

Abstract = {{Triaxial compression tests with measurements of permeability were
   performed on core granite samples taken at 450-550 m depth from the
   Beishan area in Gansu Province, a potential site for China's high-level

   in the stress-strain behaviors, the permeability of the Beishan granite
   was found to evolve with a clear permeability decrease in the initial
   microcrack closure region, a constant permeability value in the elastic
   region and a dramatic permeability increase in the crack growth region.
   The permeability increases by up to and over two orders of magnitude as
   deviatoric stress increases up to sample failure; but at a given
   deviatoric stress, the permeability reduces remarkably with the increase
   of confining pressure. An empirical upper bound permeability model was
   presented by relating the mechanisms involved in the microstructure
   alteration to the permeability change, and the experimental results were
   well simulated by the proposed model. Combined with field geological
   characterization and numerical simulation, the implications of the
   experimental results for China's HLW disposal were discussed. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Natural disasters all too often place human lives and property at risk.
   Recovery efforts following a disaster can be slow and painstaking work,
   and potentially put responders in harm's way. A system which helps
   identify defects in critical building elements (e.g., concrete columns)
   before responders must enter a structure could save lives. In this paper
   we propose such a system, centered around an imagebased
   three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction method and a new 3D crack
   detection algorithm. The image-based method is capable of detecting and
   analyzing surface damages in 3D. We also demonstrate how a robotic
   platform could be used to gather the set of images from which the
   reconstruction is created, further reducing the risk to responders. In
   this regard, image-based 3D reconstructions represent a convenient
   method of creating 3D models because most robotic platforms can carry a
   lightweight camera payload. Additionally, the proposed 3D crack
   detection algorithm also provides the advantage of being able to operate
   on 3D mesh models regardless of their data collection source. Our
   experimental results showed that the 3D crack detection algorithm
   performed well on several sample building elements, successfully
   identifying cracks, reconstructing 3D profiles, and measuring
   geometrical characteristics on damaged elements and not finding any
   cracks on intact ones. The operation and perceived benefits of the
   proposed method in a post-disaster situation are also discussed in
   detail. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Title = {{A fully coupled void damage and Mohr-Coulomb based ductile fracture
   model in the framework of a Reduced Texture Methodology}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{1-24}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper deals with the modeling of ductile fracture in the whole
   range of stress triaxiality. At high stress triaxiality, a classical
   void damage based model is used. At low stress triaxiality, the
   Mohr-Coulomb model at the slip system scale combines the resolved normal
   and shear stresses for each slip plane and direction. These two models
   are fully coupled in the framework of classical polycrystalline
   plasticity. A Reduced Texture Methodology (RTM) is used to provide the
   computational efficiency needed for numerical applications. The RTM
   approach involves a significant reduction of the number of
   representative crystallographic orientations. The model is applied to a
   6260 thin-walled aluminum extrusion. With RTM, a special hybrid
   experimental numerical procedure is used to identify all plasticity
   parameters (including texture) from mechanical experiments. The fracture
   parameters are calibrated with fracture experiments on a flat notched
   tensile specimen and the so-called butterfly shear specimen.
   Fractographic examinations show a combination of dimples and large
   smooth areas in the notched specimens (mixed fracture) and flat smooth
   areas only in the shear specimens. It highlights the need of combined
   fracture models. With the embedded new fracture model, finite element
   analyses of the notched specimen can model the through-the-thickness
   slant fracture propagating from the center towards the edges. Because of
   the very large strains in the shear specimen tests/analyses, small edge
   cracks first appear in the tensile areas before main shear cracks
   initiate and propagate along the width of the specimen. The experimental
   and numerical results are in good agreement with regard to fracture
   strains and locations, macroscopic and microscopic features. (C) 2013

Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{Fatigue of CoCr alloy stents has become a major concern in recent times,
   owing to cases of premature fracture, often driven by microstructural
   phenomena. This work presents the development of a micromechanical
   framework for fatigue design, based on experimental characterisation of
   a biomedical grade CoCr alloy, including both microscopy and mechanical
   testing. Fatigue indicator parameters (FIPs) within the micromechanical
   framework are calibrated for the prediction of microstructure-sensitive
   fatigue crack initiation (FCI). A multi-scale CoCr stent model is
   developed, including a 3D global J(2) continuum stent-artery model and a
   2D micromechanical sub-model. Several microstructure realizations for
   the stent sub-model allow assessment of the effect of crystallographic
   orientations on stent fatigue crack initiation predictions. Predictions
   of FCI are compared with traditional Basquin-Goodman total life
   predictions, revealing more realistic scatter of data for the
   microstructure-based FIP approach. Comparison of stent predictions with
   performance of a 316L stent for the same generic design exposes the
   design as over-conservative for the CoCr alloy. In response, the
   micromechanical framework is used to modify the stent design for the
   CoCr alloy, improving design efficiency. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

   components, aggregates, cement pastes, and concretes containing
   different aggregates and mortar under different heating and drying
   conditions. The change in compressive strength of concretes under
   various drying or heating conditions was explained by the behavior of
   the cement paste matrix and damage accumulation caused by differences in
   volume changes between the aggregate and mortar. In contrast, the
   variation in the Young's modulus of concrete caused by the drying or
   heating conditions was mainly explained by the increase in the number of
   voids due to internal cracking in the concrete. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The interactions of hydrogen (H) atoms with vacancies are investigated
   by means of ab initio calculations. The lowest segregation energies are
   -0.27 and -0.41 eV at single vacancies and divacancies, respectively.
   These values are in excellent agreement with those corresponding to the
   two characteristic peaks of the thermal desorption spectra. The
   microscopic interpretation of the experimental data is therefore
   clarified. An energetic model is built from the ab initio data and used
   to study the influence of H bulk concentration and temperature on the
   concentration of vacancy-H clusters. Analytical expressions, validated
   by Monte Carlo simulations, are given. The mean vacancy occupation and
   the H-induced vacancy enrichment are calculated at two temperatures
   representative of H embrittlement experiments and stress corrosion
   cracking at high temperatures. The stability domain of VH6 clusters is
   found to significantly overlap with the experimental conditions for
   embrittlement. Therefore, vacancy clustering at high concentrations can
   be qualitatively discussed based on VH6-VH6 interactions that are found
   weakly repulsive. Consequences on H damage in Ni are discussed. The
   effect of metal vibrations on segregation and local hydride stability is
   qualitatively evaluated by off-lattice Monte Carlo simulations using a
   semi-empirical Ni H potential. They are shown to shift local hydride
   stability towards higher H concentrations. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{The work presented in this paper deals with the application of different
   sensor technologies for fatigue crack damage monitoring of metallic
   helicopter fuselages. A test programme has been conducted, consisting of
   seven fatigue crack propagation tests on aluminium panels (skin with
   riveted stringers) representative of the rear fuselage of a helicopter.
   Electrical crack gauges and comparative vacuum monitoring sensors have
   been used locally to monitor propagating cracks. A network of optical
   fibre Bragg gratings is presented as a valid possibility for distributed
   monitoring (based on strain field dependence on damage), alternative to
   consolidated electrical resistance-based strain gauges. A Smart Layer
   based on piezoelectric transducers that emit and receive Lamb wave
   signals has also been analysed in this paper for distributed monitoring.
   Two damages have been considered: a skin crack artificially initiated on
   a panel bay and a skin crack propagating from a rivet hole after
   stringer failure. Damage sensitivity has been evaluated and compared
   among the considered technologies, thus providing useful recommendations
   for each considered system, together with advantages and drawbacks
   concerning their suitability for on-board installation and monitoring.
   The damage index sensitivity to operative condition, load in particular,
   is verified and compared with damage effect for distributed networks. A
   finite element model able to describe any selected feature sensitivity
   to the monitored damage is also presented as a useful tool for the
   optimization of the structural health monitoring system design process.

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic machining (USM) has been considered as a new cutting
   technology that does not rely on the conductance of the workpiece. USM
   presents no heating or electrochemical effects, with low surface damage
   and small residual stresses on workpiece material, such as glass,
   ceramics, and others; therefore, it is used to drill microholes in
   brittle materials. However, this process is very slow and tool wear
   dependent, so the entire process has low efficiency. Therefore, to
   increase microhole drilling productivity or hole quality, rotary
   ultrasonic machining (RUM) is considered as a strong alternative to USM.
   RUM, which presents ultrasonic axial vibration with tool rotation, is an
   effective solution for improving cutting speed, precision, tool wear,
   and other machining responses beyond those of the USM. This study aims
   to reduce the microchipping or cracking at the exit of the hole, which
   inevitably occurs when brittle materials are drilled, with consideration
   of tool wear. To this end, response surface analysis and desirability
   functions are used for experimental optimization. The experimental
   results showed that the proposed RUM scheme is suitable for microhole
   drilling.}},

Abstract = {{Usually, lifting and tensile stresses between the steel profile and the
   concrete slab of steel-concrete composite beams are unplanned and have
   comparatively small load ordinates compared to the transferred shear
   forces. That is why, these vertically lifting forces are generally not
   relevant for the dimensioning of the composite joint. But, this does not
   apply if shear connectors are systematically used for the anchorage of
   tensile forces. While the anchorage behavior of conventional shear
   connectors, like headed studs, is already extensively studied,
   appropriate investigations on the anchorage behavior of composite dowels
   are lacking so far, especially for composite dowels in slender and
   cracked concrete chords. In this paper, the anchorage behavior of an
   innovative, puzzle-shaped composite dowel is investigated in cracked and
   uncracked concrete chords. Besides different arrangements of
   reinforcement, the influence of different longitudinal stress levels in
   the concrete slab ( tensile stress, compressive stress) is explored, in
   particular. To this end, own test setups were developed. All tests were
   recalculated using a three-dimensional, nonlinear finite element model.
   Finally, an engineering model for the calculation of the load bearing
   capacity of single composite dowels and composite dowel groups in
   reinforced and unreinforced concrete is presented.}},

Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{211-221}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{A new crack growth-based corrosion fatigue life prediction method for
   aging reinforced concrete beam is proposed in this paper. The proposed
   method couples the corrosion growth kinetics and fatigue crack growth
   kinetics together. The relationship between corrosion damage morphology
   and corrosion loss is investigated by the experimental results. A
   phenomenological model is proposed to obtain the stress concentration
   factor model under different corrosion loss conditions. Following this,
   the developed model is integrated with an asymptotic method to calculate
   the stress intensity factor for the crack at corrosion pit roots. The
   fatigue life is predicted by the integration of the fatigue crack growth
   rate curve from the equivalent initial flaw size to the critical length.
   Probabilistic analysis methodology is proposed to consider various
   sources of uncertainties for the fatigue life prediction. Fatigue life
   prediction results are validated with experimental observations for
   various corroded steel bars and beams available in the literatures. (C)

Abstract = {{Introduction: The aim of the present study was to evaluate crack
   formation after flaring root canals with Gates Glidden drills and
   ProTaper Universal (SX; Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland),
   Endoflare (MicroMega, Besancon, France), Revo-S (MicroMega), and HyFlex
   (Coltene-Whaledent, Allsteften, Switzerland) flaring instruments.
   Methods: One-hundred eight mandibular molars were selected. Eighteen
   teeth were left unprepared to serve as negative controls; the
   experimental groups consisted of the mesiobuccal and mesiolingual root
   canals of the remaining 90 teeth, which were instrumented with the
   following coronal flaring instruments: Gates Glidden drills and ProTaper
   Universal SX, Endoflare, Revo-S SC1, and HyFlex 25.08 instruments. All
   roots were then sectioned perpendicular to the long axis at 1, 2, 3, 4,
   6, and 8 mm from the cementoenamel junction. The sections were inspected
   under a stereomicroscope, and any crack formations were recorded. The
   data were analyzed using the chi-square test (P = .05). Results: The
   Gates Glidden drills resulted in a higher rate of crack formation than
   that noted in the control group (P < .05). Flaring of the root canals
   using the ProTaper Universal, Endoflare, Revo-S, and HyFlex instruments
   resulted in crack formation similar to that of the control group (P >
   .05). Conclusions: The use of the Gates Glidden drills resulted in the
   formation of the most cracks. However, the results for the ProTaper
   Universal, Endoflare, Revo-S, and HyFlex flaring instruments were
   similar to those of the control group in terms of crack formation.}},

Abstract = {{With the aid of 3D acoustic emission (AE) monitoring system, the
   cracking process of granite under compressive stress condition and its
   effect on the hydro-mechanical properties is experimentally studied. The
   granite is taken from Beishan area, a preferable region for high-level
   radioactive waste (HLW) disposal in China. The experiment results
   suggest that the rock failure and degradation of mechanical properties
   are essentially related to the propagation and coalescence of induced
   cracks. Using an anisotropic damage tensor proposed by Shao et al., the
   damage evolution during the whole loading process is studied according
   to the experimental data It is revealed that the damage evolution is
   mainly initiated with the appearance of nonlinear mechanical behaviour,
   and accelerated close to the failure point and in post-peak region. The
   estimated damage variable in lateral direction is found be globally
   higher than the value in vertical direction. The recorded AE events
   indicate that cracking process of granite could be accelerated due to
   the existence of hydraulic pressure. As a result, much lower compressive
   strength is obtained under same effective confining pressure in
   hydro-mechanical coupling tests. A similar tendency of damage and
   permeability is noticed, and the permeability variation in granite is
   found to be negligible before the coalescence of microcracks. Finally,
   an empirical relation is proposed to describe the influence of damage
   evolution and confining pressure on permeability variation. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Thin-ply based laminates are a promising development in composite
   materials and are expected in the near future to outperform conventional
   laminates in mechanical performance. A rational design with thin plies
   requires understanding the effect of ply thickness on each damage
   mechanism. This paper presents an experimental investigation into damage
   occurrence in a quasi-isotropic laminate made from thin-ply, bi-axial,
   Non-Crimp-Fabric (NCF), under different off-axis uniaxial loadings. The
   NCF layers are positioned through the laminate thickness creating two
   regions, namely THICK and THIN (with and without ply clustering). Then,
   the onset and progress of three damage mechanisms (transverse matrix
   cracking, matrix crack induced delamination and free-edge delamination)
   for both regions are analyzed by monitoring the specimen's free-edge.
   The results show that the critical region where damage occurs is that
   with ply clustering (THICK), whereas delamination originating from
   matrix cracks or free edge effects are delayed or even suppressed in the
   THIN region. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of matrix cracking on hysteresis behavior of cross-ply
   ceramic matrix composites is investigated in the present analysis. The
   cracking of cross-ply ceramic composites was classified into five modes,
   where cracking mode 3 and mode 5 involve matrix cracking and
   fiber/matrix interface debonding in 0 degrees ply. The matrix crack
   space and interface debonded length are obtained by matrix statistical
   cracking model and fracture mechanics interface debonding criterion.
   Based on the damage mechanisms of fiber sliding relative to matrix in
   the interface debonded region, the unloading interface reverse slip
   length and reloading interface new slip length of cracking mode 3 and
   mode 5 are determined by the fracture mechanics approach. The hysteresis
   loops of four different cases for cracking mode 3 and mode 5 are derived
   respectively. The hysteresis loss energy as a function of interface
   shear stress of mode 3 and mode 5 are analyzed. The theoretical results
   have been compared with experimental data of two different cross-ply

Abstract = {{Brittle epoxy adhesive joints, between the carbon-fibre/epoxy face
   sheets and aluminium substrate, were toughened using
   randomly-distributed short aramid fibres. In this study, effects of the
   epoxy adhesive thickness on interfacial fracture toughness of the
   adhesive joints, with and without short aramid-fibre toughening, were
   investigated. Short aramid fibres of 6 or 14 mm in length with an area
   density of 12 g/m(2) were inserted between the carbon-fibre face sheet
   and aluminium substrate during the laminating process. Two and six
   layers of aluminium foils were inserted at the interface to form the
   controlled thin and thick adhesive joints, which are around 20 and 70 mu
   m in thickness. The two ``composite adhesive joints{''}, with different
   volume densities of short aramid fibres, reversed the adhesive-thickness
   influence on the interfacial toughness in comparison to that of the
   plain epoxy adhesive joints. However, both ``composite adhesive
   joints{''} with low and high aramid-fibre densities resulted in
   significant improvement in the interfacial toughness. Analytical models,
   together with optical and scanning electron microscopy observations,
   were used to explain the experimental findings, and relevant toughening
   mechanisms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper the nonlinear material response of damaged composite
   structures under periodic excitation is experimentally and numerically
   investigated. In particular, the nonlinear wave propagation problem was
   numerically analysed through a finite element model able to predict the
   nonlinear interaction of acoustic/ultrasonic waves with damage
   precursors and micro-cracks. Such a constitutive model is based on the
   Landau's semi-analytical approach to account for anharmonic effects of
   the medium, and is able to provide an understanding of nonlinear elastic
   phenomena such as the second harmonic generation. Moreover, Kelvin
   tensorial formulation was used to extend the wave propagation problem in
   orthotropic materials to the 3D Cartesian space. In this manner, the
   interaction of the stress waves with the 3D crack could be analysed.
   This numerical model was then experimentally validated on a composite
   plate undergone to impact loading. Good agreement between the
   experimental and numerical second harmonic response was found, showing
   that this material model can be used as a simple and useful tool for
   future structural diagnostic applications.}},

Abstract = {{The microscale damage mechanisms in brittle ceramics are investigated in
   detail and a Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) model is developed in this
   work to study two common failure modes in Ceramic Matrix Composites
   (CMC), i.e. matrix/interphase fracture and fiber sliding. In order to
   empower the developed framework for performing crashworthiness studies,
   the effect of the dynamic energy density content on the microscale
   fracture modes of CMCs is also considered. The CDM model is developed
   within a physically consistent framework that includes basic fracture
   mechanics of CMCs. Also the CDM model is developed in such a way that
   most of the material parameters are directly obtainable form the
   experimental data rather than cumbersome and time consuming numerical
   curve fitting techniques. In order to construct a computationally
   effective multiscale analysis platform for CMCs, this work aims to
   provide an asymptotic solution for a microscale representative volume
   element (RVE) which represents the fiber, interphase and matrix
   interactions. The developed asymptotic solution can capture the
   non-linear response of CMCs through CDM model; and it considerably
   reduces the computational cost of hierarchical multiscale analysis in
   comparison to the numerical methods, e.g. numerical models that simulate
   the real microstructure. The CDM model and the RVE asymptotic solution
   are utilized to study the microscale damage mechanisms in CMC systems.
   It is shown that the developed scheme performs quite well in capturing
   available experiments in the literature and provides a comprehensive
   description of microscale damage mechanisms in CMCs. The developed
   framework can be utilized in the future developments of the hierarchical
   multiscale analysis of CMC systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this contribution, a four-phase micromechanical model is proposed in
   order to simulate the non-linear instantaneous pre-peak response of
   cement concrete subjected to monotonically increasing loads. The
   non-linear behavior is attributed to the creation of cracks in the
   cement paste of the concrete; the effect of the cracks is taken into
   account by introducing equivalent voids in the cement paste. The
   concrete material is modeled as a four-phase composite with three
   different types of heterogeneities: gravel, sand and voids, embedded in
   a cement pure paste matrix. The composite homogenization is realized
   with the Mori-Tanaka method and the overall non-linear response of the
   concrete is determined by a secant approach. The proposed
   micromechanical model is able to capture peculiar aspects of the
   concrete stress-strain curve of uniaxial compression: in most concrete
   materials, a higher compressive strength is associated with a higher
   initial tangent Young's modulus. Further analogies between the
   theoretical curves of the proposed method and the experimental curves
   are shown. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   classification methodology for subway tunnel safety monitoring. With the
   application of high-speed complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)
   industrial cameras, the tunnel surface can be captured and stored in
   digital images. In a next step, the local dark regions with potential
   crack defects are segmented from the original gray-scale images by
   utilizing morphological image processing techniques and thresholding
   operations. In the feature extraction process, we present a distance
   histogram based shape descriptor that effectively describes the spatial
   shape difference between cracks and other irrelevant objects. Along with
   other features, the classification results successfully remove over 90\%
   misidentified objects. Also, compared with the original gray-scale
   images, over 90\% of the crack length is preserved in the last output
   binary images. The proposed approach was tested on the safety monitoring
   for Beijing Subway Line 1. The experimental results revealed the rules
   of parameter settings and also proved that the proposed approach is
   effective and efficient for automatic crack detection and
   classification.}},
