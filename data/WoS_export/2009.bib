Abstract = {{Self-healing of Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECC) subjected to
   two different cyclic wetting and drying regimes was investigated in this
   paper. To quantify self-healing, resonant frequency measurements were
   conducted throughout wetting-drying cycles followed by uniaxial tensile
   testing of self-healing ECC specimens. Through self-healing,
   crack-damaged ECC recovered 76\% to 100\% of its initial resonant
   frequency value and attained a distinct rebound in stiffness. Even for
   specimens deliberately pre-damaged with microcracks by loading up to 3\%
   tensile strain, the tensile strain capacity after self-healing recovered
   close to 100\% that of virgin specimens without any preloading. Also,
   the effects of temperature during wetting-drying cycles led to an
   increase in the ultimate strength but a slight decrease in the tensile
   strain capacity of rehealed pre-damaged specimens. This paper describes
   the experimental investigations and presents the data that confirm
   reasonably robust autogenous healing of ECC in commonly encountered
   environments for many types of infrastructure. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this study, the impact response of unidirectional glass/epoxy

   different stacking sequences, {[}0/90/0/90](s) and {[}0/90/+45/-45](s),
   were chosen in tests for comparison. All alternative method, based on
   variation of the excessive energy (E(e)) versus impact energy (E(i)), is
   presented to determine penetration threshold (Pn). The penetration
   threshold for stacking sequence {[}0/90/+45/-45](s) is found to be
   smaller than that of {[}0/90/0/90](s). The primary damage mode was found
   to be fiber fracture for higher impact energies; whereas, it was
   indentation resulting in delamination and matrix cracks for smaller
   impact energies. Contour plots of the overall damage areas are also
   depicted for several impact energies. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper is the follow-up on the previous work by the authors on the

   Constitutive models which take into account the physical progressive
   failure behaviour of fibres, matrix, and interfaces between plies were
   implemented in an explicit finite element method and used in the
   simulation of low-velocity impact events on composite laminates. The
   computational effort resulted in reliable predictions of the impact
   dynamics, impact footprint, locus and size of delaminations, matrix
   cracks and fibre damage, as well as the amount of energy dissipated
   through delaminations, intraply damage and friction. The accuracy
   achieved with this method increases the reliability of numerical methods
   in the simulation of impact loads enabling the reduction of the time and
   costs associated with mechanical testing. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this article, the physical origin of fatigue crack initiation in
   ductile metals is discussed from a historical perspective. The main
   focus is to assess those cyclic slip irreversibilities in a
   microstructural sense that occur not only at the surface but also in the
   bulk at the dislocation scale and to show how they contribute to surface
   fatigue damage. The evolution of early fatigue damage, as evidenced
   experimentally in the last decades, is reviewed. The phenomenon of
   cyclic strain localization in persistent slip bands (PSBs) and models of
   the formation of extrusions, intrusions, and microcracks are discussed
   in detail. The predictions of these models are compared with
   experimental evidence obtained on mono- and polycrystalline
   face-centered-cubic (fcc) metals. In addition, examples of the evolution
   of fatigue damage in selected fcc solid solution alloys and
   precipitation-hardened alloys and in body-centered-cubic (bcc) metals
   are analyzed. Where possible, the cyclic slip irreversibilities p,
   defined as the fraction of plastic shear strain that is
   microstructurally irreversible, have been estimated quantitatively.
   Broadly speaking, p has been found to vary over orders of magnitude (0 <
   p < 1), being almost negligible at low loading amplitudes (high fatigue
   lives) and substantial at larger loading amplitudes (low fatigue lives).}},

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional (2-D) continuous wavelet transform (CWT)-based damage
   detection algorithm using ``Dergauss2d{''} wavelet for plate-type
   structures is presented. The 2-D CWT considered in this study is based
   on the formulation by Antoine et al. (2004). A concept of isosurface of
   2-D wavelet coefficients is proposed, and it is generated to indicate
   the location and approximate shape or area of the damage. The proposed
   algorithm is a response-based damage detection technique which only
   requires the mode shapes of the damaged plates. This algorithm is
   applied to the numerical vibration mode shapes of a cantilever plate
   with different types of damage to illustrate its effectiveness and
   viability. A comparative study with other two 2-D damage detection
   algorithms, i.e., 2-D gapped smoothing method (GSM) and 2-D strain
   energy method (SEM), is performed, and it demonstrates that the proposed
   2-D CWT-based algorithm is superior in noise immunity and robust with
   limited sensor data. The algorithm is further implemented in an
   experimental modal test to detect impact damage in an FRP composite
   plate using smart piezoelectric actuators and sensors, demonstrating its
   applicability to the experimental mode shapes. The present 2-D CWT-based
   algorithm is among a few limited studies in the literature to explore
   the application of 2-D wavelets in damage detection. and as demonstrated
   in this study, it can be used as a viable and effective technique for
   damage identification of plate- or shell-type structures. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{The presence of aggressive fluids and their transport is by far the most
   important factor controlling the durability of cement based composites.
   In structural concrete, the application of mechanical stress leads to
   cracking, which in turn affects the transport properties adversely, but
   very little is known of this influence. The paper highlights the vast
   discrepancy between experimentally determined permeability data, which
   appear to be largely artifacts of disparate test procedures. In
   particular, it is not clear if an equilibrium was attained in the fluid
   flow and further, whether the flow measurements were made in the
   presence of the applied stress, which together make it very difficult to
   compare experimental data. Nevertheless it is clear that stress induced
   cracking leads to a surge in fluid flow and there exists a threshold
   value for both the applied stress and the resultant crack width
   associated with fluid permeability in concrete. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

   fracture energy of adhesive joints under pure mode II loading using the

   proposed methodology also accounts for the energy dissipated at the
   Fracture Process Zone which is not negligible when ductile adhesives are
   used. Experimental tests and numerical analyses using a trapezoidal
   cohesive mixed-mode damage model demonstrated the good performance of
   the new method. namely when compared to classical data reduction
   schemes. An inverse method was used to determine the cohesive
   properties, fitting the numerical and experimental load-displacement

Abstract = {{This study focuses on the description of damage and failure behaviour of
   triaxial braided carbon/epoxy composites under tension. The tensile
   tests were instrumented with optical surface strain and acoustic
   emission measurements. Damage was observed using X-ray and microscopy.
   The damage develops in two stages: (I) intra-yarn cracking: increase of
   the crack density and crack length, (2) local inter-yarn delamination
   and conjunction of the intra-yarn cracks. Statistics of crack sizes at
   both stages were collected and the 3D geometry of cracks was
   reconstructed. A finite element model of the unit cell of the textile
   reinforcement is used to predict damage initiation and crack orientation
   using Puck's criterion. Progressive damage and stiffness deterioration
   is modelled using the degradation scheme of Murakami-Ohno and the damage
   evolution law of Ladeveze, applied to the average stress state of the
   yarns. Good agreement with experimental damage initiation threshold and
   non-linear tensile diagrams is found both for loading in fibre and
   off-axis directions. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A two-component healing agent consisting of epoxy- and ((C(2)H(5))(2)O

   catalyzed by (C(2)H(5))(2)O.BF(3) belongs to cationic chain
   polymerization, which is characterized by fast reaction at ambient
   temperature and low catalyst concentration. The experimental results
   showed that cracks in the composites containing the above healing system
   can be quickly re-bonded with satisfied healing efficiency. In the case
   of 5 wt\% epoxy- and 1 wt\% (C(2)H(5))(2)O center dot BF(3)-loaded
   capsules, for example, a similar to 80\% recovery of impact strength was
   detected within 30 min at 20 degrees C. Because the healing capsules
   took effect at low content, mechanical properties of the matrix were
   largely retained. It is believed that the present healing system

Abstract = {{Composites fabricated by VARTM technology with the use of single-ply
   non-crimp 3D orthogonal woven preforms 3WEAVE (R) find fast growing
   research interest and industrial applications. It is now well understood
   and appreciated that this type of advanced composites provides efficient
   delamination suppression, enhanced damage tolerance, and superior
   impact, ballistic and blast performance characteristics over 2D fabric
   laminates. At the same time, this type of composites, having practically
   straight in-plane fibers, show significantly better in-plane stiffness
   and strength properties than respective properties of a
   ``conventional{''} type 3D interlock weave composites. One primarily
   important question, which has not been addressed yet, is how the
   in-plane elastic and strength characteristics of this type of composites
   compare with respective in-plane properties of ``equivalent{''}
   laminates made of 2D woven fabrics. This 2-part paper presents a
   comprehensive experimental study of the comparison of in-plane tensile
   properties of two single-ply non-crimp 3D orthogonal weave E-glass fiber
   composites on one side and a laminate reinforced with four plies of
   plain weave E-glass fabric on the other. Results obtained from
   mechanical testing are supplemented by acoustic emission data providing
   damage initiation thresholds, progressive cracks observation, full-field
   surface strain mapping and cracks observation on micrographs. The
   obtained results demonstrate that the studied 3D non-crimp orthogonal
   woven composites have considerably higher in-plane ultimate failure
   stresses and strains, as well as damage initiation strain thresholds
   than their 2D woven laminated composite counterpart. Part I presents the
   description of materials used, experimental techniques applied,
   principal results and their mutual comparisons for the three tested
   composites. Part 2 describes in detail the experimentally observed
   effects and trends with the main focus on the progressive damage:
   detailed results of AE registration, full-field strain measurements and
   progressive damage observations, highlighting peculiarities of local
   damage patterns and explaining the succession of local damage events,
   which leads to the differences in strength values between 2D and 3D
   composites. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper was to address the effects of laser shock
   processing (LSP) on the residual stresses and micro-hardness of the
   turbojet engine blades manufactured by LY2 aluminum alloy, and fatigue
   performance of the notched specimens cut from LY2 blade plate. First,
   the effects of the number of shocks used in LSP on the residual stresses
   and micro-hardness at the edge of the turbojet engine blade were
   investigated. Second, the low cyclic fatigue performance on the
   specimens cut from the blade was evaluated. Experimental results showed
   that the compressive residual stresses and the high micro-hardness would
   be generated near the surface due to LSP. The thickness of the plastic
   deformation layer generated due to the shock wave in LSP was higher than
   2.0 mm. By comparing with the untreated specimens, the fatigue lives of
   the specimens after LSP were obviously increased due to the compressive
   residual stresses near the surface. Crown Copyright (c) 2008 Published

Abstract = {{This paper presents the application of Lamb waves to inspect damage in
   composite laminates. The proposed methodology employs a network of
   transducers that are used to sequentially scan the structure before and
   after the presence of damage by transmitting and receiving Lamb wave
   pulses. A damage localization image is reconstructed by analyzing the
   cross-correlation of the scatter signal envelope with the excitation
   pulse envelope for each transducer pair. A potential damage area is then
   reconstructed by superimposing the image observed from each actuator and
   sensor signal path. Both numerical and experimental case studies are
   used to verify the proposed methodology for composite laminates.
   Three-dimensional finite element models with a transducer network
   consisting of four transducer elements are used in the numerical case
   studies. The experimental case studies employ a transducer network using
   four piezoelectric transducers as transmitter elements and a laser
   vibrometer to measure the response signals at four locations close to
   the transducers. The results show that the method enables the reliable
   detection of structural damage with locating inaccuracies of the order
   of a few millimeters inside as well as outside of an inspection area of
   100 x 100 mm(2).}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical robustness of atomic layer deposited alumina and recently
   developed molecular layer deposited aluminum alkoxide ({''}alucone{''})
   films, as well as laminated composite films composed of both materials,
   was characterized using mechanical tensile tests along with a recently
   developed fluorescent tag to visualize channel cracks in the transparent
   films. All coatings were deposited on polyethylene naphthalate
   substrates and demonstrated a similar evolution of damage morphology
   according to applied strain, including channel crack initiation, crack
   propagation at the critical strain, crack densification up to
   saturation, and transverse crack formation associated with buckling and
   delamination. From measurements of crack density versus applied tensile
   strain coupled with a fracture mechanics model, the mode I fracture
   toughness of alumina and alucone films was determined to be K(IC) = 1.89
   +/- 0.10 and 0.17 +/- 0.02 MPa m(0.5), respectively. From measurements
   of the saturated crack density, the critical interfacial shear stress
   was estimated to be tau(c) = 39.5 +/- 8.3 and 66.6 +/- 6.1 MPa,
   respectively. The toughness of nanometer-scale alumina was comparable to
   that of alumina thin films grown using other techniques, whereas alucone
   was quite brittle. The use of alucone as a spacer layer between alumina
   films was not found to increase the critical strain at fracture for the
   composite films. This performance is attributed to the low toughness of
   alucone. The experimental results were supported by companion
   simulations using fracture mechanics formalism for multilayer films. To
   aid future development, the modeling method was used to study the
   increase in the toughness and elastic modulus of the spacer layer
   required to render improved critical strain at fracture. These results
   may be applied to a broad variety of multilayer material systems
   composed of ceramic and spacer layers to yield robust coatings for use
   in chemical barrier and other applications. (C) 2009 American Institute

Abstract = {{This Part 2 paper presents results of comparative experimental study of
   progressive damage in 2D and 3D woven glass/epoxy composites under
   in-plane tensile loading. As Part 1, this Part 2 work is focused on the
   comparison of in-plane tensile properties of two non-crimp single-ply 3D
   orthogonal weave E-glass fibre composites on one side and a laminate
   reinforced with four plies of E-glass plain weave on the other. The
   damage investigation methodology combines mechanical testing with
   acoustic emission registration (that provides damage initiation
   thresholds), progressive cracks observation on transparent samples,
   full-field surface strain mapping and cracks observation on micrographs,
   altogether enabling for a thorough characterisation of the local micro-
   and meso-damage modes of the studied composites. The obtained results
   demonstrate that the non-crimp 3D orthogonal woven composites have
   significantly higher in-plane strengths, failure strains and damage
   initiation thresholds than their 2D woven laminated counterpart. The
   growth of transverse cracks in the yarns of 3D composites is delayed,
   and they are less prone to a yarn-matrix interfacial crack formation and
   propagation. Delaminations developing between the plies of plain weave
   fabric in the laminate at certain load level never appear in the 3D
   woven single-ply composites. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical studies on the failure of composites have mostly employed the
   finite element method. However, it can be rather challenging to predict
   failure using this method. The assumption of lamina homogeneity is
   questionable when predicting failure, though it is suitable for stress
   analysis. Matrix cracking, fiber breakage, and delamination are inherent
   to the inhomogeneous nature of the composite, thus the assumption of
   material homogeneity taints the failure prediction. It is, therefore,
   essential that the inhomogeneous nature of the composites must be
   retained in the analysis in order to predict the correct failure modes.
   Hence, this study considers distinct properties of the fiber and matrix
   and their volume fractions and fiber orientations while modeling
   composite laminates. The peridynamic theory is employed to predict the
   damage in center-cracked laminates with different fiber orientations.
   The predictions from the peridynamic analysis agree with the
   experimental observations published in the literature. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A model enabling the detection of damages developing during a low
   velocity/low energy impact test on laminate composite panels has been
   elaborated. The ply model is composed of interface type elements to
   describe matrix cracks and volumic finite elements. This mesh device
   allows to respect the material orthotropy of the ply and accounts for
   the discontinuity experimentally observed. Afterwards delaminations are
   described with interfaces similar to the ones observed with matrix
   cracks and the coupling between these two damages are established. In
   the first step, simple stress criteria are used to drive these interface
   type elements in order to assess the relevance of model principle.
   Nevertheless, the well known problem of mesh sensitivity of these
   criteria prevents the use of this model for now as a predictive tool but
   rather as a qualitative tool. An experimental validation is carried out
   thanks to impact experimental tests performed by Aboissiere (2003) and a
   very good match has been found. However, this model could predictivelly
   be used and would allow to foresee an original method to detect
   delaminations during an experimental test. This modelling has been
   successfully tested experimentally and compared to a C-Scan ultrasonic
   investigation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fracture mode of ductile solids can vary depending on the history of
   stress state the material experienced. For example. ductile plates under
   remote in-plane loading are often found to rupture in mode I or mixed
   mode I/III. The distinct crack patterns are observed in many different
   metals and alloys, but until now the underlying physical principles,
   though highly debated, remain unresolved. Here we show that the existing
   theories are not capable of capturing the mixed mode I/III due to a
   missing ingredient in the constitutive equations. We introduce an
   azimuthal dependent fracture envelope and illustrate that two competing
   fracture mechanisms, governed by the pressure and the Lode angle of the
   stress tensor, respectively, exist ahead of the crack tip. Using the
   continuum damage plasticity model, we demonstrate that the distinctive
   features of the two crack propagation modes in ductile plates can be
   reproduced using three dimensional finite element simulations. The
   magnitude of the tunneling effect and the apparent crack growth
   resistance are calculated and agree with experimental observations. The
   finite element mesh size dependences of the fracture mode and the
   apparent crack growth resistance are also investigated. Published by

Abstract = {{The effects of Ni-YSZ cermet re-oxidation in anode supported Solid Oxide
   Fuel Cells (SOFCs) have been investigated. Damage mechanisms have been
   studied in both cases of direct oxidation in air (i.e., fuel shutdown)
   or by an ionic current (i.e., fuel starvation).
   Direct oxidation tests show that the electrolyte cracks for a conversion
   degree of Ni into NiO ranging between similar to 58 and similar to 71\%.
   This failure mode has been modelled considering both the bulk expansion
   of the cermet induced by the transformation of the Ni phase and the
   change of mechanical stresses in the multilayered cell.
   In the case of fuel starvation, a thin layer of the cermet was
   electrochemically re-oxidised at 800 degrees C and then reduced under a
   hydrogen stream. This `redox' cycle was repeated until the degradation
   of the cell. The evolution of the impedance diagrams recorded after each
   cycle suggests that the cermet damages in an area close to
   anode/electrolyte interface. The mechanical modelling states that a
   delamination can occur along the interface between the Anode Functional
   Layer(AFL) and the Anode Current Collector (ACC) substrate. This
   theoretical result confirms the experimental trends observed by
   impedance spectroscopy. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Discrete element method (DEM) was employed in the research works
   presented in this paper to simulate the microscopic machining process of
   ceramics. A densely packed particle assembly system of the
   polycrystalline SiC has been generated in DEM software package PFC2D

   part numerically. Microscopic mechanical properties of SiC were
   calibrated by comparing the numerical tests in PFC2D with the equivalent

   ceramic machining process. The dynamic process of initiation and
   propagation of the micro-cracks under various machining conditions has
   been explicitly modeled in the DEM simulations. The numerical results
   from DEM modeling agreed well with the experimental observations and

   ceramics and cutting conditions have been established based on the
   analysis of simulation results. A generalized model of defining the

Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Modal curvature is more sensitive to structural damage than directly
   measured mode shape, and the standard Laplace operator is commonly used
   to acquire the modal curvatures from the mode shapes. However, the
   standard Laplace operator is very prone to noise, which often leads to
   the degraded modal curvatures incapable of identifying damage. To
   overcome this problem, a novel Laplacian scheme is proposed, from which
   an improved damage identification algorithm is developed. The proposed
   step-by-step procedures in the algorithm include: (1) By progressively
   upsampling the standard Laplace operator, a new Laplace operator is
   constructed, from which a Laplace operator array is formed; (2) by
   applying the Laplace operator array to the retrieved mode shape of a
   damaged structure, the multiresolution curvature mode shapes are
   produced, on which the damage trait, previously shadowed under the
   standard Laplace operator, can be revealed by a ridge of multiresolution
   modal curvatures; (3) a Gaussian filter is then incorporated into the
   new Laplace operator to produce a more versatile Laplace operator with
   properties of both the smoothness and differential capabilities, in
   which the damage feature is effectively strengthened: and (4) a
   smoothened nonlinear energy operator is introduced to further enhance
   the damage feature by eliminating the trend interference of the
   multiresolution modal curvatures, and it results in a significantly
   improved damage trait. The proposed algorithm is tested using the data
   generated by an analytical crack beam model, and its applicability is
   validated with an experimental program of a delaminated composite beam
   using scanning laser vibrometer (SLV) to acquire mode shapes. The
   results are compared in each step, showing increasing degree of
   improvement for damage effect. Numerical and experimental results
   demonstrate that the proposed novel Laplacian scheme provides a
   promising damage identification algorithm, which exhibits apparent
   advantages (e.g., high-noise insusceptibility, insightful in damage
   revealment, and visualized damage presentation) over the standard
   Laplace operator. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of the size of the aggregate on ASR expansion has already
   been well illustrated. This paper presents a microscopic model to
   analyze the development of ASR expansion of mortars containing reactive
   aggregate of different sizes. The attack of the reactive silica by
   alkali was determined through the mass balance equation, which controls
   the diffusion mechanism in the aggregate and the fixation of the alkali
   in the ASR gels. The mechanical part of the model is based on the damage
   theory in order to assess the decrease of stiffness of the mortar due to
   cracking caused by ASR and to calculate the expansion of a
   Representative Elementary Volume (REV) of concrete. Parameters of the

Abstract = {{An analytical approach for crack identification procedure in uniform
   beams with an open edge crack, based on bending vibration measurements,
   is developed in this research. The cracked beam is modeled as two
   segments connected by a rotational mass-less linear elastic spring with
   sectional flexibility, and each segment of the continuous beam is
   assumed to obey Timoshenko beam theory. The method is based on the
   assumption that the equivalent spring stiffness does not depend on the
   frequency of vibration, and may be obtained from fracture mechanics. Six
   various boundary conditions (i.e., simply supported, simple-clamped,
   clamped-clamped, simple-free shear, clamped-free shear, and cantilever
   beam) are considered in this research. Considering appropriate
   compatibility requirements at the cracked section and the corresponding
   boundary conditions, closed-form expressions for the characteristic
   equation of each of the six cracked beams are reached. The results
   provide simple expressions for the characteristic equations, which are
   functions of circular natural frequencies. crack location, and crack
   depth. Methods for solving forward solutions (i.e., determination of
   natural frequencies of beams knowing the crack parameters) are discussed
   and verified through a large number of finite-element analyses. By
   knowing the natural frequencies in bending vibrations, it is possible to
   study the inverse problem in which the crack location and the sectional
   flexibility may be determined using the characteristic equation. The
   crack depth is then computed using the relationship between the
   sectional flexibility and the crack depth. The proposed analytical
   method is also validated using numerical studies on cracked beam
   examples with different boundary conditions. There is quite encouraging
   agreement between the results of the present study and those numerically
   obtained by the finite-element method. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In metals, during high cycle fatigue on plain specimens, almost the
   entire fatigue life is spent as short crack initiation and propagation.
   The fatigue short crack life can be schematically divided into two
   subsequent phases: microstructurally short crack and physically short
   crack. Recently, Chapetti proposed a physically short crack threshold
   and propagation driving force model {[}Chapetti MD. Fatigue propagation
   threshold of short cracks under constant amplitude loading. Int J
   Fatigue 2003;25(12):1319-1326]. In his model the physically short crack
   behavior is obtained from the long crack propagation, just introducing
   the reduced threshold due to unsaturated closure. In the present paper
   the physically short crack propagation is similarly modeled by means of
   a driving force equation, but independent from the long crack
   propagation. In this way, a better description of the short crack
   behavior is provided, however short crack propagation data is required.
   Physically short crack propagation model parameters were obtained, by
   fitting experimental data drawn from the literature, for two aluminum
   alloys and a titanium alloy at two different heat treatment conditions
   and load ratios.
   By calculating the physically short crack plus long crack propagation,
   and assuming microstructurally short crack as part of the initiation
   stage, a purer information about crack initiation can be drawn from the
   S-N curves, and it is shown in the paper for the investigated materials.
   A precise crack initiation size and the number of cycles just for
   initiation are then provided. This information is useful to accurately
   predict fatigue life for blunt notched and for thick components, where
   the propagation is much higher than in the small plain specimen.
   A validation of the model was obtained by predicting the fatigue life of
   a notched specimen. An accurate prediction was obtained both when the
   initiation was much smaller than propagation and when almost the entire
   fatigue life was initiation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{High Performance Fiber Reinforced Cementitious Composites (HPFRCC) show
   strain hardening behavior accompanied with multiple micro-cracks under
   static tension. The high ductility and load carrying capacity resulting
   from their strain hardening behavior is expected to increase the
   resisting capacity of structures subjected to extreme loading
   situations, e.g., earthquake, impact or blast. However, the promise of
   HPFRCCs for dynamic loading applications stems from their observed good
   response under static loading. In fact, very little research has been
   conducted to investigate if their good static response translates into
   improved dynamic response and damage tolerance. This experimental study
   investigates the tensile behavior of HPFRCC using High strength steel
   fibers (High strength hooked fiber and twisted fiber) under various
   strain rates ranging from static to seismic rates. The test results
   indicate that the tensile behavior of HPFRCC using twisted fiber shows
   rate sensitivity while that using hooked fiber shows no rate
   sensitivity. The results also show that rate sensitivity in twisted
   fibers is dependent upon both fiber volume fraction and matrix strength,
   which influences the interface bond properties.}},

Abstract = {{A computational strategy is developed to characterize the driving force
   for fatigue crack nucleation at subsurface primary inclusions in
   carburized and shot peened C61 (R) martensitic gear steels. Experimental
   investigation revealed minimum fatigue strength to be controlled by
   subsurface fatigue crack nucleation at inclusion clusters under cyclic
   bending. An algorithm is presented to simulate residual stress
   distribution induced through the shot peening process following
   carburization and tempering. A methodology is developed to analyze
   potency of fatigue crack nucleation at subsurface inclusions.
   Rate-independent 3D finite element analyses are performed to evaluate
   plastic deformation during processing and service. The specimen is
   subjected to reversed bending stress cycles with R = 0.05,
   representative of loading on a gear tooth. The matrix is modeled as an
   elastic-plastic material with pure nonlinear kinematic hardening. The
   inclusions are modeled as isotropic, linear elastic. Idealized inclusion
   geometries (ellipsoidal) are considered to study the fatigue crack
   nucleation potency at various subsurface depths. Three distinct types of
   second-phase particles (perfectly bonded, partially debonded, and
   cracked) are analyzed. Parametric studies quantify the effects of
   inclusion size, orientation and clustering on subsurface crack
   nucleation in the high cycle fatigue (HCF) or very high cycle fatigue
   (VHCF) regimes. The nonlocal average values of maximum plastic shear
   strain amplitude and Fatemi-Socie (FS) parameter calculated in the
   proximity of the inclusions are considered as the primary driving force
   parameters for fatigue crack nucleation and microstructurally small
   crack growth. The simulations indicate a strong propensity for crack
   nucleation at subsurface depths in agreement with experiments in which
   fatigue cracks nucleated at inclusion clusters, still in the compressive
   residual stress field. It is observed that the gradient from the surface
   of residual stress distribution, bending stress, and carburized material
   properties play a pivotal role in fatigue crack nucleation and small
   crack growth at subsurface primary inclusions. The fatigue potency of
   inclusion clusters is greatly increased by prior interfacial damage
   during processing. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Concrete structures undergo an uncontrollable damage process manifesting
   in the form of cracks due to the coupling of fatigue loading and
   environmental effects. In order to achieve long-term durability and
   performance, continuous health monitoring systems are needed to make
   critical decisions regarding operation, maintenance and repairs. Recent
   advances in nanostructured materials such as carbon nanotubes have
   opened the door for new smart and advanced sensing materials that could
   effectively be used in health monitoring of structures where wireless
   and real time sensing could provide information on damage development.
   In this paper, carbon nanotube networks were embedded into a cement
   matrix to develop an in situ wireless and embedded sensor for damage
   detection in concrete structures. By wirelessly measuring the change in
   the electrical resistance of the carbon nanotube networks, the progress
   of damage can be detected and monitored. As a proof of concept, wireless
   cement-carbon nanotube sensors were embedded into concrete beams and
   subjected to monotonic and cyclic loading to evaluate the effect of
   damage on their response. Experimental results showed that the wireless
   response of the embedded nanotube sensors changes due to the formation
   of cracks during loading. In addition, the nanotube sensors were able to

Abstract = {{In this article, the physical origin of fatigue crack initiation in
   ductile metals is discussed from a historical perspective. The main
   focus is to assess those cyclic slip irreversibilities in a
   microstructural sense that occur not only at the surface but also in the
   bulk at the dislocation scale and to show how they contribute to surface
   fatigue damage. The evolution of early fatigue damage, as evidenced
   experimentally in the last decades, is reviewed. The phenomenon of
   cyclic strain localization in persistent slip bands (PSBs) and models of
   the formation of extrusions, intrusions, and microcracks are discussed
   in detail. The predictions of these models are compared with
   experimental evidence obtained on mono- and polycrystalline
   face-centered-cubic (fcc) metals. In addition, examples of the evolution
   of fatigue damage in selected fcc solid solution alloys and
   precipitation-hardened alloys and in body-centered-cubic (bcc) metals
   are analyzed. Where possible, the cyclic slip irreversibilities p,
   defined as the fraction of plastic shear strain that is
   microstructurally irreversible, have been estimated quantitatively.
   Broadly speaking, p has been found to vary over orders of magnitude (0 <
   p < 1), being almost negligible at low loading amplitudes (high fatigue
   lives) and substantial at larger loading amplitudes (low fatigue lives).}},

Abstract = {{A novel progressive damage and failure model for fiber reinforced
   laminated composites is presented in this work. The model uses the
   thermodynamically based Schapery Theory (ST) to model progressive
   microdamage in the matrix phase. Matrix failure is not governed with a
   matrix failure criterion, but rather matrix failure occurs naturally
   through the evolution of microdamage. A maximum strain criterion is used
   to dictate tensile failure in the fiber direction, while compressive
   failure is automatically accounted for by allowing local fiber rotations
   and tracking the evolution of rotation. The results of this model are
   compared to a previously developed model that used ST at the lamina
   level to calculate matrix microdamage, but used the Generalized Method
   of Cells to resolve the lamina level strains into constituent level
   stresses and strains and determines constituent failure by evaluating
   failure criteria at the micro, fiber/matrix level. Results for global
   load versus displacement and local strain from both models are compared
   to experimental data for notched laminates loaded in uniaxial tension.
   The results show remarkable agreement qualitatively, and in many cases
   the quantitative agreement is good. Accurate damage contours and failure
   paths are predicted.}},

Abstract = {{Recent experimental evidence has reiterated that ductile fracture is a
   strong function of stress triaxiality. Under high stress triaxiality
   loading, failure occurs as a result of void growth and subsequent
   necking of inter-void ligaments while under low stress triaxiality
   failure is driven by shear localization of plastic strain in these
   ligaments due to void rotation and distortion. The original Gurson model
   is unable to capture localization and fracture for low triaxiality,
   shear-dominated deformations unless void nucleation is invoked. A
   phenomenological modification to the Gurson model that incorporates
   damage accumulation under shearing has been proposed. Here we further
   extend the model and develop the corresponding numerical implementation
   method. Several benchmark tests are performed in order to verify the
   code. Finally, the model is utilized to model quasi-static punch-out
   experiments on DH36 steel. It is shown that the proposed modified Gurson
   model, in contrast to the original model, is able to capture the
   through-thickness development of cracks as well as the punch response.
   Thus, the computational fracture approaches based on the modified Gurson
   model may be applied to shear-dominated failures. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper deals with online controlled propagation and vibration-based
   detection of fatigue cracks in metal beams constituted of two different
   materials: 6082-T651 aluminium alloy and Fe430 steel. The study
   addresses the initiation and propagation of cracks in the structures and
   their influence on the free-vibration dynamic response. One of the
   original aspects is the introduction of an actual fatigue crack instead
   of - as is usual - a narrow slot.
   First, the crack growth is predicted analytically by numerically
   integrating the Paris-Walker equation. Then, three-point bending tests
   are performed to obtain edge transverse cracks; two original control
   procedures enable the tests to be traced, the results of which are
   compared with the numerical predictions.
   Second, free vibrations of undamaged and cracked cantilever beams are
   excited by hammer impact. The experimental results are compared with the
   numerical solutions of a finite element model including local
   flexibility increase at crack opening. The differences between the
   dynamic behaviours of the intact and cracked beams in terms of frequency
   and damping allow the damage to be detected. Even if this is a `linear'
   method, it seems to enable the crack presence to be detected and to
   account for the so-called `breathing' crack. These features open the
   door to future developments towards nonlinear detection methods.}},

Abstract = {{Abrasive jet micromachining (AJM) is a non-traditional technology that
   can effectively remove hard and brittle materials at high cut quality. A
   key requisite in modelling the AJM process is to determine the
   velocities of abrasive particles. In this paper, a theoretical analysis
   for particle velocities within a micro-abrasive air jet is presented and
   the associated particle velocity models are developed. The particle
   velocities at the nozzle exit are determined based on the nozzle length,
   particle mean diameter, particle density, air density and air flow
   velocity. The distribution of particle velocities along the jet
   centerline downstream from the nozzle and the particle velocity profile
   at a jet cross-section are also modelled considering surrounding air
   entrainment and air-particle interaction. A numerical solution to the
   models is developed to determine the particle velocities by dividing the
   nozzle and the jet flow in air into small segments along the jet axial
   direction. The developed models are finally verified by comparing the
   calculated particle velocities with those from a particle image
   velocimetry (PIV) measurement of the velocity distribution in
   micro-abrasive air jets. It is shown that the model calculations and the
   corresponding experimental results are in good agreement with less than
   4\% average errors. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The guided wave (GW) field excited by a wedge-shaped, anisotropic
   piezocomposite transducer, surface-bonded on an isotropic substrate is
   investigated with applications to large area structural health
   monitoring. This investigation supports the development of the composite
   long-range variable-direction emitting radar (CLoVER) transducer. The
   analysis is based on the three-dimensional equations of elasticity, and
   the solution yields expressions for the field variables that are able to
   capture the multimodal nature of GWs. The assumption of uncoupled
   dynamics between the actuator and substrate is used, and their
   interaction is modeled through shear tractions along the transducer's
   radial edges. A similar problem is modeled using three-dimensional
   finite element simulations to assess the spatial and transient accuracy
   of the solution. Experimental tests are also conducted on pristine
   structures to validate the accuracy of the theoretical approach. The
   experimental studies employ CLoVER transducers developed in-house, and
   their manufacturing procedure is briefly described. Frequency response
   experiments based on piezoelectric sensors are conducted to assess the
   performance of the solution in the frequency domain. These tests are
   complemented by laser vibrometer measurements that allow the spatial and
   temporal evolution of the solution to be evaluated. The numerical
   simulations and experimental tests show that the wave time of arrival,
   radial attenuation, and azimuthal distribution are well captured by the
   theoretical solution.}},

Abstract = {{A crack detection technique based on nonlinear acoustics is investigated
   in this study. Acoustic waves at a chosen frequency are generated using
   an actuating lead zirconate titanate (PZT) transducer, and they travel
   through the target structure before being received by a sensing PZT
   wafer. Unlike an undamaged medium, a cracked medium exhibits high
   acoustic nonlinearity which is manifested as harmonics in the power
   spectrum of the received signal. Experimental results also indicate that
   the harmonic components increase nonlinearly in magnitude with

Abstract = {{This paper treats the problem of elastic response of composite laminates
   containing matrix cracks in plies of multiple orientations. The approach
   taken has been described as synergistic damage mechanics (SDM) and has
   been previously illustrated for {[}0(m)/ +/- 0(n)/0(m/2)](s) laminates
   with cracks of equal density in +0 and -0 plies {[}Singh, C.V., Talreja,
   R., 2008. Int. J. Solids Struct. 45(16), 4574-4589]. The current work
   extends the approach to {[}0(m)/ +/- 0(n)/90(r)](s) and {[}0(m)/90(r)/
   +/- 0(n)](s) laminates with cracks additionally in the 90 degrees-plies.
   The interaction between the +/- 0-cracks and the 90 degrees-cracks is
   analyzed in terms of the crack surface displacements using a
   three-dimensional finite element (FE) model and found to be significant
   only for crack orientations close to 90 degrees. The stiffness
   degradation of the laminate with all cracking modes simultaneously
   present is formulated by continuum damage mechanics using a second order
   tensor characterization of damage. The elastic moduli changes predicted
   by the SDM procedure are validated by independent three-dimensional FE
   calculations. For a particular case of quasi-isotropic {[}0/90/ -/+
   45](s) laminate, the elastic moduli predictions are evaluated against
   experimental data. Finally, a parametric study is performed to examine
   the effects of ply thickness changes on stiffness properties. Published

Abstract = {{The interaction between residual stress and fatigue crack growth rate
   has been investigated in middle tension and compact tension specimens
   machined from a variable polarity plasma arc welded aluminium alloy
   2024-T351 plate. The specimens were tested at three levels of applied
   constant stress intensity factor range. Crack closure was continuously
   monitored using an eddy current transducer and the residual stresses
   were measured with neutron diffraction. The effect of the residual
   stresses on the fatigue crack behaviour was modelled for both specimen
   geometries using two approaches: a crack closure approach where the
   effective stress intensity factor was computed; and a residual stress
   approach where the effect of the residual stresses on the stress ratio
   was considered. Good correlation between the experimental results and
   the predictions were found for the effective stress intensity factor
   approach at a high stress intensity factor range whereas the residual
   stress approach yielded good predictions at low and moderate stress
   intensity factor ranges. In particular, the residual stresses
   accelerated the fatigue crack growth rate in the middle tension specimen
   whereas they decelerated the growth rate in the compact tension sample,
   demonstrating the importance of accurately evaluating the residual
   stresses in welded specimens which will be used to produce damage
   tolerance design data. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cracking in asphalt concrete is one of the major causes of structural
   and functional deterioration of pavement systems. Various experimental
   and numerical approaches with typical specimen size have been applied to
   analyze the fracture mechanism of asphalt concrete but the specimen size
   dependency on the fracture has an important role. Herein, the clustered
   discrete element method (DEM) approach was applied into the
   investigation of size effect on fracturing of asphalt concrete based on
   a disk-shaped compact tension (DC(T)) test. A bilinear cohesive
   softening model was implemented into the DEM framework to enable
   simulation of crack initiation and propagation in asphalt concrete. The
   laboratory tests were conducted for specimen sizes of asphalt concrete
   varying from 100 to 450 mm. Micromechanical fracture modeling approach
   was also applied to investigate the heterogeneous fracture behaviors for
   different specimen sizes. Image processing procedure was conducted to
   determine the microstructure of asphalt specimen and to project it into
   the numerical mesh. The specimen size dependency of asphalt concrete was
   captured by the developed experimental fracture test and the clustered
   DEM fracture model was able to accurately predict the size-dependent
   fracture behavior when considering viscoelasticity and heterogeneity.

Abstract = {{At the onset of fracture in materials with process zones, the fracture
   resistance, or R curve, rises as the process zone develops. After
   process zone development, crack propagation proceeds by steady state
   growth. By considering J integral contours inside and outside the
   process zone, the available energy can be partitioned into crack tip
   energy release rate and process zone energy. To model the rising R
   curve, however, required assumptions about damage mechanisms in the
   process zone and partitioning of its energy into released and
   recoverable energy. By considering process zones that are elastic
   fiber-bridging zones with softening regions caused by fiber breakage or
   damage, equations for rising R curves were derived as a function of
   crack tip toughness and bridging zone mechanics. The new methods were
   implemented into the Material Point Method for generalized numerical
   crack propagation simulations with bridging zones. The simulation method
   includes pure fracture mechanics and pure cohesive zone models as
   extreme special cases. The most realistic simulations for many materials
   will likely fall between these two extremes. The results guided comments

Abstract = {{Higher strength high temperature Nickel superalloys are required to
   increase the operational efficiency of gas turbine aeroengines through
   higher operating temperatures. This paper reports on research to assess
   the workpiece surface sensitivity of a new Ni-based superalloy, RR1000,
   to hole making by drilling (roughing) and plunge milling (finishing).
   Coarse grain (CG) RR1000 displays a unique combination of mechanical and
   thermal properties making it even more difficult-to-machine than
   traditional Ni-based alloys (e.g. Inconel, Waspaloy). Cutting speed,
   feed rate, cutting edge quality (i.e. flank wear level) and cooling
   conditions have been varied across a wide range for drilling and plunge
   milling to produce hole surfaces. For the first time, the sub-surface
   damage and axial and hoop residual stress distribution have been
   quantified. The experimental trials have been directed towards an
   assessment of the proclivity for surface malformations and detrimental
   residual stress profiles under controlled machining conditions. Material
   deformation from drilling was found to be most significant in the hoop
   direction where increasingly severe levels of material drag, cracking
   and white layering occurred as the material removal rate was increased.
   Surface hardening occurred around all of the drilled holes. The
   amplitude and the depth below the free surface of the tensile residual
   stress increased with the material removal rate most probably due to a
   rise of temperature at the tool-workpiece interface during drilling.
   Plunge milling was found to be an effective finishing operation,
   successfully removing undesirable material properties introduced by
   abusive drilling processes provided that adequate stock of material was
   removed from the superficially damaged workpiece. This enabled the
   generation of essentially damage-free surfaces, as are necessary for
   safety critical components used in gas turbine aeroengines. (C) 2008

Abstract = {{Within sheet metal forming, crashworthiness analysis in the automotive
   industry and ship research on collision and grounding, modelling of the
   material failure/fracture, including the behaviour at large plastic
   deformations, is critical for accurate failure predictions. In order to
   validate existing failure models used in finite element (FE) simulations
   in terms of dependence on length scale and strain state, tests recorded
   with the optical strain measuring system ARAMIS have been conducted.
   With this system, the stress-strain behaviour of uniaxial tensile tests
   was examined locally, and from this information true stress-strain
   relations were calculated on different length scales across the necking
   region. Forming limit tests were conducted to study the multiaxial
   failure behaviour of the material in terms of necking and fracture. The
   failure criteria that were verified against the tests were chosen among
   those available in the FE software Abaqus and the Bressan-Williams-Hill
   (BWH) criterion proposed by Alsos et at, 2008. The experimental and
   numerical results from the tensile tests confirmed that Barba's relation
   is valid for handling stress-strain dependence on the length scale used
   for strain evaluation after necking. Also, the evolution of damage in
   the FE simulations was related to the processes ultimately leading to
   initiation and propagation of a macroscopic crack in the final phase of
   the tensile tests. Furthermore, numerical simulations using the BWH
   criterion for prediction of instability at the necking point showed good
   agreement with the forming limit test results. The effect of
   pre-straining in the forming limit tests and the FE simulations of them
   is discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Many of historical structures have degenerated in time by environmental
   effects, earthquakes, and winds because of the inadequate preservation.
   The preservation of historical heritage is considered a fundamental
   issue in the cultural life of modern societies. The protective measures
   can be supplied if the actual behaviour of the structures is known. The
   paper presents the results of ambient vibration test and operational
   modal analysis carried out on the historical masonry bell-tower of the
   Hagia Sophia church in Trabzon, Turkey. The bell-tower is about 23 m
   high and dates back to the XIII century. The study includes also the
   initial analytical model of the tower constituted by the geometrical
   survey. The experimental measurements are performed using two
   measurement setups in different times. In the first setup twelve
   uniaxial accelerometers are used, while in the second setup four
   triaxial accelerometers with one uniaxial reference are used with the
   aim of determining the bending and torsional mode shapes as well as
   natural frequencies and modal damping ratios of the tower. The
   analytical model of the tower is developed by using solid brick
   elements, and a relatively large number of finite elements have been
   used in the model to obtain a regular distribution of mass. The first
   five natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes are determined
   from both theoretical and experimental modal analyses and compared with
   each other. A good harmony is attained between mode shapes, but there
   are some differences between natural frequencies. The sources of the
   differences are introduced in terms of variations in the elasticity
   modulus of walls, cracks on upper walls, and boundary conditions on base
   level.}},

Abstract = {{The efficiency and reliability of modern jet engines strongly depend on
   the performance of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs), which prevent
   melting and oxidation of the turbine blades' structural core. The
   system's lifetime is limited by cracks appearing in and in the vicinity
   of an oxide layer that grows in the TBC under thermal cycling. High
   replacement costs have led to an increased demand to identify, quantify
   and remedy damage in TBCs. An integrated experimental-numerical approach
   is presented for studying the main, particularly interfacial
   irregularities. Damage at several stages of oxidation in TBCs is
   analyzed in factors that contribute to damage. samples with predefined
   interfacial irregularities. The model predicts the experimentally
   observed crack patterns, clearly quantifying the influence of
   imperfections and indicating that damage can be delayed by Surface
   treatment. (C) 2009 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Models for numerical failure analysis of wooden structures}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{571-579}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Numerical simulations of wooden structures using the finite element
   method require close-to-reality material models, Suitable element
   technologies and reliable path-following algorithms. In the present
   paper, anisotropic continuum material models for elasticity and ductile
   failure behaviour of wood are discussed. The material model for ductile
   failure can be considered as a phenomenological plastic
   characterisation. It bases on a multi-surface plasticity formulation
   with anisotropic, moisture and temperature dependent yield surfaces and
   direction dependent post-failure behaviour. Cohesive elements permit the
   discrete modelling of tension and shear cracks. An interface element
   formulation is presented including an anisotropic traction separation
   law for wood. This model contains coupling of failure modes which can be
   determined experimentally. Furthermore, the material approach considers
   an efficient and stable formulation for damage. The models are evaluated
   on the basis of comparisons between simulation results and experimental
   investigations. For this purpose, two standard test specimens and a
   glulam beam with cylindric holes are used. It is shown, that the
   described formulations can be used for a realistic simulation of the
   mechanical behaviour of wooden structures. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All
