Abstract = {{The capability of embedded piezoelectric wafer active sensors (PWAS) to
   excite and detect tuned Lamb waves for structural health monitoring is
   explored. First, a brief review of Lamb waves theory is presented.
   Second, the PWAS operating principles and their structural coupling
   through a thin adhesive layer are analyzed. Then, a model of the Lamb
   waves tuning mechanism with PWAS transducers is described. The model
   uses the space domain Fourier transform. The analysis is performed in
   the wavenumber space. The inverse Fourier transform is used to return
   into the physical space. The integrals are evaluated with the residues
   theorem. A general solution is obtained for a generic expression of the
   interface shear stress distribution. The general solution is reduced to
   a closed-form expression for the case of ideal bonding which admits a
   closed-form Fourier transform of the interfacial shear stress. It is
   shown that the strain wave response varies like sin gamma alpha, whereas
   the displacement response varies like sinc gamma alpha. Maximum coupling
   is achieved when the PWAS length equals the half wavelength of a
   particular Lamb wave mode. Since Lamb wave modes wavelengths vary with
   frequency, the tuning of certain modes at certain frequencies can thus
   be achieved. Tuning curves are derived and verified against experimental
   results. A particular S-0 mode `sweet spot' is found at 300 kHz for a
   7-mm PWAS attached to a 1.6-min aluminum plate. Crack detection via the
   pulse echo technique using the phased array principle and tuned So mode
   Lamb waves is demonstrated as an effective structural health monitoring
   method.}},

Abstract = {{A model for fatigue crack growth (FCG) analysis based on the
   elastic-plastic crack tip stress-strain history was proposed. The
   fatigue crack growth was predicted by simulating the stress-strain
   response in the material volume adjacent to the crack tip and estimating
   the accumulated fatigue damage. The fatigue crack growth was regarded as
   a process of successive crack re-initiation in the crack tip region. The
   model was developed to predict the effect of the mean stress including
   the influence of the applied compressive stress. A fatigue crack growth
   expression was derived using both the plane strain and plane stress
   state assumption. It was found that the FCG was controlled by a two
   parameter driving force in the form of: Delta K = K-max(p),(tot)Delta
   K-tot((1-p)). The driving force was derived on the basis of the local
   stresses and strains at the crack tip using the Smith-Watson-Topper
   (SWT) fatigue damage parameter: D=sigma(max)Delta epsilon/2.The effect
   of the internal (residual) stress induced by the reversed cyclic
   plasticity was accounted for the subsequent analysis. Experimental
   fatigue crack growth data sets for two aluminum alloys (7075-T6 and
   2024-T351) and one steel alloy (4340) were used for the verification of
   the model. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Micromechanical models for fracture initiation that incorporate local
   failure criteria have been widely developed for metallic and ceramic
   materials; however, few such micromechanical models have been developed
   for the fracture of bone. In fact, although the fracture event in
   ``hard{''} mineralized tissues such as bone is commonly believed to be
   locally strain-controlled, only recently has there been experimental
   evidence (using double-notched four-point bend testing) to support this
   widely held belief. In the present study, we seek to shed further light
   on the nature of the local cracking events that precede catastrophic
   fracture in human cortical bone, and to define their relationship to the
   microstructure. Specifically, numerical computations are reported that
   demonstrate that the stress and strain states ahead of such a notch are
   qualitatively similar irrespective of the deformation mechanism
   (pressure-insensitive plasticity vs. pressure-sensitive microcracking).
   Furthermore, we use the double-notched test to examine
   crack-microstructure interactions from a perspective of determining the
   salient toughening mechanisms in bone and to characterize how these may
   affect the anisotropy in fracture properties. Based on preliminary
   micromechanical models of these processes, the relative contributions of
   various toughening mechanisms are established. In particular, crack
   deflection and uncracked-ligament bridging are identified as the major
   mechanisms of toughening in cortical bone. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Corrosion of embedded reinforcement is the most prevalent form of
   degradation of reinforced concrete structures, and may impair structural
   capacity through loss of bar section, loss of bond between reinforcement
   and concrete as a result of longitudinal cracking, or loss of concrete
   cross section. The effect of corrosion attack on mechanical properties
   of reinforcement is investigated through physical tests on bars with
   simulated and real corrosion damage and through a simple numerical
   model. Bars subjected to local or pitting attack may suffer a relatively
   modest loss of strength but a significant loss of ductility, and this is
   related principally to the variability of attack along the length of the
   bar The numerical model supplements experimental work through a
   parametric study on the influence of steel characteristics. Finally,
   guidelines on assessment are suggested that are derived from results

Abstract = {{Osteonal bone is often compared to a composite material and to metals as
   discontinuities within the material may provide sites of stress
   concentration for crack initiation and serve as barriers to crack
   growth. However, little experimental data exist to back up these
   hypotheses. Fluorescent chelating agents were applied at specific
   intervals to bone specimens fatigue tested in cyclic compression at a
   stress range of 80 MPa. The failed specimens were sectioned and labelled
   microcracks identified using UV epifluorescence microscopy. Microcrack
   lengths were measured and their relationship to cement lines Surrounding
   secondary osteons recorded. Microcrack length at the time of
   encountering a cement line was also measured. Microcracks of less than
   100 mu m stopped growing when they encountered a cement line.
   Microcracks of greater than 100 mu m in length continued to grow after
   encountering a cement line surrounding an osteon. Only microcracks
   greater than 300 mu m in length were capable of penetrating osteons and
   these microcracks were the only ones which were observed to cause
   failure in the specimen. These experimental data support the hypothesis
   that secondary osteons act as barriers to crack propagation in compact
   bone. However, it shows that this microstructural barrier effect is
   dependent on the crack length at the time of encountering an osteon. For
   the vast majority of cracks, osteons act as barriers to growth but for
   the minority of cracks that are long enough and do break through the
   cement line, an osteon may actually act as a weakness in the bone and
   facilitate crack propagation. (c) 2004 Orthopaedic Research Society.

   in order to study the strength and failure of mechanically fastened

   using a non-contact electro-optical extensometer to measure hole
   elongation is proposed. During static tensile testing, the response of
   bearing damage was monitored by acoustic emission measurement. Several
   specimens were observed by means of soft X-ray radiography and SEM at
   different loading levels to assess internal damage. The observations
   indicate that the bearing failure can be outlined as a process of
   compressive damage accumulation, and can be divided into the following
   four stages: damage onset; damage growth; local fracture; structural
   fracture. Major features of bearing failure include fiber
   micro-buckling, matrix cracking, delamination and out-of-plane shear
   cracking. Bearing strength and failure mode should also depend on the

Abstract = {{Concrete is a quasi-brittle material, where tensile failure involves
   progressive micro-cracking, debounding and other complex irreversible
   processes of internal damage. Strain-softening is a dominate feature and
   advanced numerical schemes have to be applied in order to circumvent the
   ill-posdness of the Boundary-Value Problem to deal with. Throughout the
   paper we pursue the cohesive zone approach, where initialization and
   coalescence of micro-cracks is lumped into the cohesive fracture process
   zone in terms of accumulation of damage. We develop and employ a
   (discrete) constitutive description of the cohesive zone, which is based
   on a transversely isotropic traction separation law. The model reflects
   an exponential decreasing traction with respect to evolving opening
   displacement and is based on the theory of invariants. Non-negativeness
   of the damage dissipation is proven and the associated numerical
   embedded representation is based on the Partition of Unity Finite
   Element Method. A consistent linearization of the method is presented,
   where particular attention is paid to the (cohesive) traction terms.
   Based on the proposed concept three numerical examples are studied in
   detail, i.e. a double-notched specimen under tensile loading, a four
   point shear test and a pull-out test of unreinforced concrete. The
   computational results show mesh-independency and good correlation with
   experimental results. \&COPY; 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a coupled constitutive model is proposed for anisotropic
   damage and permeability variation in brittle rocks under deviatoric
   compressive stresses. The formulation of the model is based on
   experimental evidences and main physical mechanisms involved in the
   scale of microcracks are taken into account. The proposed model is
   expressed in the macroscopic framework and can be easily implemented for
   engineering application. The macroscopic free enthalpy of cracked solid
   is first determined by approximating crack distribution by a
   second-order damage tensor. The effective elastic properties of damaged
   material are then derived from the free enthalpy function. The damage
   evolution is related to the crack growth in multiple orientations. A
   pragmatic approach inspired from fracture mechanics is used for the
   formulation of the crack propagation criterion. Compressive stress
   induced crack opening is taken into account and leads to macroscopic
   volumetric dilatancy and permeability variation. The overall
   permeability tensor of cracked material is determined using a
   micro-macro averaging procedure. Darcy's law is used for fluid flow at
   the macroscopic scale whereas laminar flow is assumed at the microcrack
   scale. Hydraulic connectivity of cracks increases with crack growth. The
   proposed model is applied to the Lac du Bonnet granite. Generally, good
   agreement is observed between numerical simulations and experimental
   data. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Fatigue damage requires to be expressed in terms of a crack. This will
   be revealed by several items of experimental evidence. First,
   observations on a medium carbon steel that relate to the initiation
   zones and the propagation of small cracks subjected to low cycle
   fatigue, will be presented; these observations being based on surface
   replica studies. It will be shown that the Coffin-Manson high-strain,
   low-cycle, fatigue relationship is substantially the same as a crack
   growth law. Second, the effect of prior fatigue history on the growth
   rate of a small crack is investigated systematically using special
   specimens containing an artificial small hole of various diameters, i.e.
   40, 100 and 200 Pm. Prior fatigue history is shown to have little
   influence on the crack growth rate in the high-strain fatigue regime.
   Third, it will be revealed that the loss of fracture ductility after
   strain cycling in high-strain fatigue tests is attributable to the
   existence of small surface cracks. The loss of fracture ductility
   depends on the crack length l. If I is larger than a critical length
   1(c), the fatigue crack causes macroscopic shear fracture in a tensile
   test following strain cycling. On the other hand, if I is smaller than
   1(c), the tensile fracture surfaces are of the cup-and-cone type. For
   70/30 brass, 1(c) is about 400 mu m. Thus, fatigue damage models which
   ignore the reality of fatigue damage as expressed in terms of cracks
   should not be used for fatigue life predictions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In order to select high erosion resistant materials or to estimate
   erosion damage caused by solid particle impact in actual cases, it is
   very important to take the mechanical properties of a material into
   account. It is well known that material hardness is closely related to
   erosion damage to materials. Another mechanical property apart from
   material hardness should be investigated, since the material hardness is
   not necessarily an essential indicator for industrially useful
   materials. From the fact that material removal is caused by indentation
   processes, material hardness is clearly one of the predominant
   parameter. It is also proposed that a new mechanical property directly
   associated with erosion damage exists in the indentation phenomenon. In
   quasi-static indentation tests using a WC ball, load relaxation after
   the completion of the indentation was measured and characterized for
   aluminum, copper, carbon steel and stainless steel specimens. It was
   found that the degree of load relaxation depended upon the ability of
   plastic flow for soft materials and upon brittleness accompanied by
   intergranular cracks between composite phases for hard metallic
   materials. It was concluded that a predictive equation containing both
   material hardness and the load relaxation ratio could be related to
   estimate experimental erosion damage data for many types of materials
   under a variety of impact conditions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a feasibility study on an
   impedance-based damage detection technique using thickness modes of
   piezoelectric (PZT) patches for steel structures. It is newly proposed
   to analyze the changes of the impedances of the thickness modes

   shifts rather than those of the lateral modes (frequency range > 20 kHz)
   at the PZT based on its root mean square (RMS) deviations, since the
   former gives more significant variations in the resonant frequency
   shifts of the signals for identifying localities of small damages under
   the same measurement condition. In this paper, firstly, a numerical
   analysis was performed to understand the basics of the NDE technique
   using the impedance using an idealized 1-D electro-mechanical model
   consisting of a steel plate and a PZT patch. Then, experimental studies
   were carried out on two kinds of structural members of steel.
   Comparisons have been made between the results of crack detections using

Abstract = {{A theoretical framework which allows determining the whole set of 2-D
   thermornechanical constants of a damaged laminate as a function of crack
   density in different layers is presented. In this approach, closed-form
   expressions, which contain thermoelastic ply properties, laminate layup,
   and crack density as the input information are obtained. It is shown
   that the crack opening displacement (COD) and crack face sliding
   displacement, normalized with respect to a load variable, are important
   parameters in these expressions influencing the level of the properties
   degradation. They are determined in this paper using generalized plain
   strain FEM analysis results for noninteractive cracks. The strong
   dependence of the COD on the relative stiffness and thickness of the
   surrounding layers, found in this study, is described by a power law.
   The methodology is validated and the possible error introduced by the
   noninteractive crack assumption is estimated by comparing with the 3-D
   FEM solution for a cross-ply laminate with two orthogonal systems of ply
   cracks. Experimental data and comparison with other models are used for

Abstract = {{This study is devoted to the ductile-brittle transition behavior of a
   French A508 Cl3 (16MND5) steel. Due to its importance for the safety
   assessment of PWR vessels, a full characterization of this steel with
   Charpy V-notch test in this range of temperature was undertaken. The aim
   of this study is to provide a wide experimental database and
   microstructural observations to supply, calibrate and validate models
   used in a local approach methodology. Mechanical and fracture properties
   of the steel have been investigated over a wide range of temperatures
   and strain-rates. Effects of impact velocity on ductile-brittle
   transition curve, on ductile tearing and on notch temperature rise are
   presented and discussed. A detailed study of ductile crack initiation
   and growth in Charpy specimens is also carried out. From fractographic
   investigations of the microvoids nucleation around carbide second phase
   particles, a plastic strain threshold for nucleation is determined for
   this material. A508 Cl3 steels undergo a transition in fracture
   toughness properties with temperature, due to a change in fracture mode
   from microvoids coalescence to cleavage fracture. A systematic
   investigation on the nature and the position of cleavage triggering
   sites and on any change in the ductile to brittle transition (DBT) range
   has been carried out. This leads to the conclusion that manganese
   sulfide inclusions do not play an increasing role with increasing test
   temperature as recently mentioned in other studies on A508 Cl3 steel
   with a higher sulfur content. In a companion paper {[}Tanguy et al.,

Abstract = {{This paper describes the results of an experimental investigation and a
   numerical simulation on the impact damage on a range of sandwich panels.
   The test panels are representative of the composite sandwich structure
   of the engine nacelle Fan Cowl Doors of a large commercial aircraft. The
   low-velocity impact response of the composites sandwich panels is
   studied at five energy levels, ranging from 5 to 20 J, with the
   intention of investigating damage initiation, damage propagation, and
   failure mechanisms. These impact energy levels are typically causing
   barely visible impact damage (BVID) in the impacted composite facesheet.
   A numerical simulation was performed using LS-DYNA3D transient dynamic
   finite element analysis code for calculating contact forces during
   impact along with a failure analysis for predicting the threshold of
   impact damage and initiation of delaminations. Good agreement was
   obtained between numerical and experimental results. In particular, the
   numerical simulation was able to predict the extent of impact damage and
   impact energy absorbed by the structure. The results of this study is
   proving that a correct numerical model can yield significant information
   for the designer to understand the mechanism involved in the
   low-velocity impact event, prior to conducting tests, and therefore to
   design a more efficient impact-resistant aircraft structure. (c) 2005

   aluminium alloy widely used in the aerospace application. Since in
   industrial problems, the surface quality is often variable, the impact
   of a unidirectional roughness is investigated via varying the roughness
   of the counter body in the fretting experiments. As expected,
   experimental results show a large effect of the contact roughness on the
   crack nucleation conditions. Rationalisation of the crack nucleation
   boundary independently of the studied roughnesses was successfully
   obtained by introducing the concept of effective contact area. This does
   show that the fretting crack nucleation of the studied material can be
   efficiently described by the local effective loadings inside the

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of an experimental study designed to
   investigate the combined effect of corrosion and sustained loads on the
   structural performance of reinforced concrete beams. A total of nine
   beams, each measuring 152 x 254 x 3200 mm, were tested. One beam was
   tested as a virgin while eight beams were exposed to accelerated
   corrosion for up to 310 days using an impressed current technique. Four
   beams were corroded under a sustained load that corresponded to
   approximately 60\% of the yield load of the virgin beam. The four
   remaining beams were kept unloaded during the corrosion exposure. Test
   results showed that the presence of a sustained load and associated
   flexural cracks during corrosion exposure significantly reduced the time
   to corrosion cracking and slightly increased the corrosion crack width.
   The presence of flexural cracks during corrosion exposure initially
   increased the steel mass loss rate and, consequently, the reduction in
   the beam strength. As time progressed, no correlation between the
   reduction in the beam strength and the presence of flexural cracks was
   observed.}},

Abstract = {{A method for prediction of location and size of multiple cracks based on
   measurement of natural frequencies has been verified experimentally for
   slender cantilever beams with two and three normal edge cracks. The
   analysis is based on energy method and representation of a crack by a
   rotational spring. For theoretical prediction the beam is divided into a
   number of segments and each segment is considered to be associated with
   a damage index. The damage index is an indicator of the extent of strain
   energy stored in the rotational spring. The crack size is computed using
   a standard relation between stiffness and crack size. Number of measured
   frequencies equal to twice the number of cracks is adequate for the
   prediction of location and size of all the cracks. The accuracy of
   prediction of crack details is encouraging. The maximum error in
   predicting location of cracks decreases with an increase in the number
   of cracks. It is less than 10\% and 20\% for two and three cracks
   respectively. The maximum error in predicting the crack size is less
   than 12\% and 30\% respectively for the two cases. A strategy to
   overcome failure in the prediction for cases with one of the cracks
   located near an anti-node has been suggested. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1659-1685}},
Abstract = {{A microstructure-based viscoplastic continuum model is developed for the
   permanent deformation of asphalt concrete (AC). The model accounts for
   several phenomena that influence the permanent deformation of AC at high
   temperatures. These phenomena include strain rate dependency, confining
   pressure dependency, dilation, aggregate friction, anisotropy, and
   damage.
   The material anisotropy was included in the model by replacing the
   stress invariants in the yield function with invariants of both the
   stress and a microstructure tensor, which describes the aggregate
   orientation distribution. The components of the microstructure tensor
   were deter-mined using image analysis techniques (IAT) conducted on
   digital images taken from two-dimensional cut sections of AC.
   Furthermore, damage was included in the model based on the effective
   stress theory to account for crack and air void growth that
   significantly reduces the load-carrying capacity of the material.
   Experimental data from triaxial compressive strength tests conducted at
   five strain rates and three confining pressures were used to develop a
   methodology to determine the material parameters that characterize AC
   permanent deformation. The model predictions were in a good agreement
   with the experimental measurements. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

   addition, analysing the relationship of residual stress with rolling
   contact fatigue is an important study, which will provide guidelines on
   the design, process and manufacturing of these elements. During this
   research, ring crack defects were induced in ceramic rolling contact
   bearing elements. A compressive residual stress value of -73 MPa near
   the ring crack and a comparatively lower value of - 12 MPa on the
   contact indicate sub-surface crack initiation and propagation. The
   average fatigue spall ranges from 100 to 148 mu m in depth.
   Within the spall area residual stress measurements suggest that

   speed). The second part concerns the numerical modeling of the
   orthogonal cutting in statics for the simple case of fibers orientated

   experimental study of the cut highlights the great influence of the
   angle between the fiber orientation and the direction of cutting speed
   of the tool on the chip formation as well as the rupture modes.
   Numerical computation is based on the fracture process and more
   particularly on the computation of the energy release rate by the method

Abstract = {{A closing crack causes the dynamic behaviour of a vibrating system to be
   significantly nonlinear. The main distinctive features of such a
   vibrating system are the appearance of sub- and superharmonic
   resonances, and the significant nonlinearity of the vibration responses
   at sub- and superharmonic resonances (displacement, acceleration,
   strain, etc.). The nonlinear effects are much more sensitive to the
   presence of a crack than are either the change of natural frequencies
   and mode shapes or the generation of high harmonics in the spectrum of
   vibration at principal resonance or far from resonance. Thus, the
   appearance of sub- and superharmonic resonances may prove to be useful,
   highly sensitive indicators of a crack's presence at very early stages
   of its nucleation; moreover, the level of response nonlinearity in this
   regime may provide a quantitative evaluation of damage parameters (type,
   size and location).
   At the same time, the manifestation of nonlinear effects depends not
   only on the crack parameters but also on the level of damping in a
   vibrating system. Recent experimental tests have revealed that crack
   nucleation and growth result in an increase of damping in a vibrating
   system. Consequently, the influence of crack's parameters upon the
   nonlinear effects should be determined while taking into account the
   change of damping in a vibrating system rather than assuming either
   constant damping or the total absence of damping.}},

Abstract = {{In addition to corrosion, fatigue cracking is another important factor
   of age related structural degradation, which has been a primary source
   of costly repair work of aging steel structures. Cracking damage has
   been found in welded joints and local areas of stress concentrations
   such as at the weld intersections of longitudinals, frames and girders.
   Fatigue cracking has usually been dealt with as a matter under cyclic
   loading, but it is also important for residual strength assessment under
   monotonic extreme loading, because fatigue cracking reduces the ultimate
   strength significantly under certain circumstances.
   In this paper, an experimental and numerical study on the ultimate
   strength of cracked steel plate elements subjected to axial compressive
   or tensile loads is carried out. The ultimate strength reduction
   characteristics of plate elements due to cracking damage are
   investigated with varying size and location of the cracking damage, both
   experimentally and numerically. Ultimate strength tests on cracked steel
   plates under axial tension and cracked box type steel structure models
   under axial compression are undertaken. A series of ANSYS nonlinear
   finite element analyses for cracked plate elements are performed. Based
   on the experimental and numerical results obtained from the present
   study, theoretical models for predicting the ultimate strength of
   cracked plate elements under axial compression or tension are developed.
   The results of the experiments and numerical computations obtained are
   documented. The insights developed will be very useful for the ultimate
   limit state based risk or reliability assessment of aging steel plated
   structures with cracking damage. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   can predict the transverse tensile stress responsible for these cracks
   by considering the interaction between the aggregate and the mortar and
   the development of damage in the latter. When concrete is exposed to
   high temperature, as is the case during fire, the failure mode is
   thermal spalling. In order to improve the prediction of the stresses
   involved in this failure Ortiz's model is extended to account for the
   effects of high temperature. Published experimental results for uniaxial
   and biaxial compression at high temperatures are used to calibrate the
   temperature dependence of some of the material properties. The transient
   creep strain is accounted for by modifying the constrained thermal
   strain. The stress analysis is coupled with hygro-thermal analysis of
   heat, mass transfer and pore pressure build-up. The effect of pore
   pressure on the damage evolution is modeled by applying a body force in
   the stress analysis module proportional to the pressure gradient. A
   numerical example of concrete under fire is solved and the computed
   results are discussed. Spalling is predicted when the damage variable
   reaches its maximum value of unity. The predicted depth and time of
   spalling for a range of variation of permeability and initial liquid

Abstract = {{Presented is a new microplane model for concrete, labeled M5, which
   improves the representation of tensile cohesive fracture by eliminating
   spurious excessive lateral strains and stress locking for far postpeak
   tensile strains. To achieve improvement, a kinematically constrained
   microplane system simulating hardening nonlinear behavior (nearly
   identical to previous Model M4 stripped of tensile softening) is coupled
   in series with a statically constrained microplane system simulating
   solely the cohesive tensile fracture. This coupling is made possible by
   developing a new iterative algorithm and by proving the conditions of
   its convergence. The special aspect of this algorithm (contrasting with
   the classical return mapping algorithm for hardening plasticity) is that
   the cohesive softening stiffness matrix (which is not positive definite)
   is used as the predictor and the hardening stiffness matrix as the
   corrector. The softening cohesive stiffness for fracturing is related to
   the fracture energy of concrete and the effective crack spacing. The
   postpeak softening slopes on the microplanes can be adjusted according
   to the element size in the sense of the crack band model. Finally, an
   incremental thermodynamic potential for the coupling of statically and
   kinematically constrained microplane systems is formulated. The data
   fitting and experimental calibration for tensile strain softening are
   relegated to a subsequent paper in this issue, while all the nonlinear
   triaxial response in compression remains the same as for Model M4.}},

Abstract = {{A novel element-failure method (EFM) has been used with a recently
   proposed micromechanics-based failure criterion SIFT for the modeling of
   progressive damage in composite laminates. The element-failure concept
   is a potentially practical method for the modelling of damage, fracture
   and delamination in fiber-reinforced composite laminates. When the
   modeled damage is propagating within a finite element, the element is
   considered to have partially failed, but not removed from the
   computations. Consequently, only a fraction of the stresses that were
   computed before the damage entered the element contribute to the nodal
   forces of the element. The concept is especially useful when extended to
   composite structures because the nature of damage in composite laminates
   is generally diffused, characterized by multiple matrix cracks, fiber
   pullout, fiber breakage and delaminations. It is usually not possible to
   identify crack tips in the fashion of traditional fracture mechanics.
   Since parts of a damaged composite structure are often able to partially
   transmit load despite the presence of some damage, it is advantageous to
   model the damaged portions with partially failed elements. The damage
   may be efficiently modeled and tracked using element-failure concepts,
   with the application of appropriate failure criteria and damage
   evolution laws. The idea is to embody the effects of damage into the
   effective nodal forces of the finite element. Here, we report the novel
   use of element-failure concepts with a recently proposed composites
   failure criterion called the strain invariant failure theory (SIFT) in
   the prediction of damage progression and delamination in a composite
   laminate subjected to three-point bend. The predicted damage propagation
   patterns are in good agreement with experimental observation when the
   EFM is used with SIFT. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, single-L composite peel joints are investigated under
   tensile loading. The adhesive peel fillet is the critical component
   regarding joint failure, with sub-critical damage developing in the
   composite. Optimisation of the joint can be achieved by changing the
   fillet shape. A method of adhesive injection was applied to guarantee
   repeatable joint designs. Experimental testing shows an increase in
   joint strength of up to 100\% by altering the fillet shape. Numerically,
   sub-critical composite failure, composite delamination and adhesive
   failure are investigated. Adhesive failure criteria are reviewed and
   compared to the experimental outcome. A zone criterion was found to
   predict the failure load best for different fillet shapes, while a
   damage mechanics approach could be applied to simulate the crack growth
   during adhesive failure. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, experimental tests in tension on a RT-PMMA material have
   been achieved under various constant true strain rates and at room

   mechanisms. Modified viscoplastic constitutive equations for homogeneous
   glassy polymers at isothermal loading, including strain softening and
   strain hardening, are proposed. Such a model is based upon an approach
   originally developed for metals at high temperature. Next, this modified
   model is coupled with a micromechanics formulation, using the
   Gurson-Tvergaard model, to investigate the macroscopic mechanical
   response of the RT-PMMA. The constitutive relation includes strain
   softening, strain hardening, strain rate sensitivity and void evolution.

Abstract = {{Feasibility of introducing compositional gradients to the core of a
   sandwich structure and the resulting fracture behavior under impact
   loading conditions is the primary focus of the study. Model sandwich
   structures comprising of graded core with bilinear variation of volume
   fraction of hollow microballoons are considered for experimental and
   numerical simulations. Conventional sandwiches with homogeneous core are
   also developed for comparison. The crack tip in both configurations is
   positioned such that global as well as local material characteristics
   are matched in both models. Dynamic mode-I crack tip deformations are
   mapped experimentally using optical interferometry and high-speed
   photography. Measurement of fracture parameter histories is used to
   demonstrate equivalence between graded and conventional architectures.
   The fracture behavior in sandwich core is explained using independent
   experimental results obtained from monotonically graded foam sheets. The
   measurements up to crack initiation are also used to validate finite
   element models. The numerical models are subsequently used in a
   parametric study of different elastic impedance gradients in the core on
   mixed-mode fracture performance of graded sandwich structures having a
   crack at the face-sheet/core interface under stress-wave loading
   conditions. The results show significant reduction in stress
   intensification in the presence of compositional gradients when compared

Abstract = {{The production of American Petroleum Institute (API) class steels using
   the traditional controlled rolling route rather than the process
   involving accelerated cooling necessitates a careful adjustment of steel
   composition associated with the optimization of the rolling schedule for
   the deformation and phase transformation characteristics of these
   modified alloys. The current work presents a study of two, NbCr and
   NbCrMo, steel systems. The microstructure obtained is correlated not
   only with the resulting mechanical properties, but also with the
   weldability and resistance to damage in the aggressive environments to
   which the materials are exposed. The evaluation of the steels was
   undertaken at two stages along the production route, sampling the
   material as plate and as tubular product, according to the API 5L 2000
   standard. Tensile testing, Charpy-V impact testing, and hardness
   measurements were used to determine the mechanical properties, and
   microstructural characterization was performed by optical and scanning
   electron microscopy. The results showed that it was possible to obtain
   good impact properties, for both steels, in plate and tube formats. The
   Charpy-V impact energy, measured at -20 degreesC from 100 to 250 J
   corresponds to a toughness level above that required by the API 5L 2000
   standard, which specifies 68 to 101 J at 0 degreesC. The yield strength
   (YS) to ultimate tensile strength (UTS) ratio was determined to be 0.8,
   the API standard establishing a maximum limit of 0.93. Both of the
   alloys investigated exhibited a bainitic microstructure and were
   successfully processed to fabricate tubular products by the ``UOE{''}
   (bending in ``U{''}, closing in ``O,{''} and expanding ``E{''}) route.
   With regard to weldability, the two experimental steels exhibited a
   heat-affected zone (HAZ) for which toughness levels (using the
   temperature associated with a 100 J impact energy as a base for
   comparison). were higher than those for both the base metal (BM) and the
   weld metal (WM) itself. In order to perform the evaluation of the
   behavior of the steels in an aggressive environment, more specifically
   their resistance to the deleterious effects of H2S, Slow strain rate
   tests (SSRTs) were carried out, immersing the samples in a sodium
   thiosulfate solution during the tests. Thou h no secondary cracking was
   observed in the test samples, the ductility levels measured were lower
   than those for the same materials tested in air. Constant load tests
   were also conducted according to the standard NACE conditions. Despite
   the more aggressive nature of the test solution in these cases, no
   samples of either steel suffered failure.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive analysis of deformation and fracture of thin plates
   subjected to localized impulsive loading is presented. The paper
   addresses many aspects of the problem including calibration for
   plasticity and fracture, and detailed description of three stages of
   dynamic response, i.e. dishing, discing and petalling. Because of a
   rather broad coverage, the paper is divided into two parts with a
   clearly defined focus of each part.
   In Part I, the transient response of the plates under a localized pulse
   loading was investigated analytically and numerically.-A precise
   determination of the transient and permanent deformation of plates in
   the so-called dishing stage is important for the prediction of the onset
   of fracture, which will be dealt with in Part II. The final deflected
   shapes of the plates obtained numerically were shown to agree well with
   the wave type solution developed earlier by one of the present authors
   and the experimental results available in the literature. Several new
   aspects of the transient response of plates, not previously reported
   were identified and discussed. A comprehensive parametric study on the
   dynamically loaded plates with various spatial and temporal
   distributions of dynamic pressure was then conducted. It was observed
   that the permanent shape of the plate is strongly dependent on the
   spatial distribution of pressure loading. Furthermore, a comparison
   between the response of circular and square plates was also presented.
   In Part II, the onset of circumferential cracking and subsequent
   propagation of radial cracks were predicted analytically and
   numerically. The accumulated equivalent plastic strain with the stress
   triaxiality as a weighting function was introduced as a ductile fracture
   criterion. An accurate representation of the true stress-strain curve
   and the critical damage/fracture function for AH36 steel material were
   calibrated from tensile tests on round specimen and parallel numerical
   simulations. By calculating distributions and histories of stress and
   strain, the initiation site and extent of fracture were predicted by the
   present fracture criterion. It was clearly shown that the fracture
   pattern of thin circular plates consisting of discing followed by
   petalling can be predicted with great realism provided the fracture
   criterion is properly formulated. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A cohesive zone model was used in conjunction with the finite volume
   method to model the dynamic fracture of single edge notched tensile
   specimens of PMMA under essentially static loading conditions. In this
   study, the influence of the shape of the cohesive law was investigated,
   whilst keeping the cohesive strength and separation energy constant.
   Cohesive cells were adaptively inserted between adjacent continuum cells
   when the normal traction across that face exceeded the cohesive strength
   of the material. The cohesive constitutive law was therefore initially
   rigid, and the effective elasticity of the material was unaltered prior
   to insertion of the cohesive cells. Notch depths ranging from 2.0 to 0.1
   mm were considered. The numerical predictions were compared with
   experimental observations for each notch depth and excellent qualitative
   and quantitative agreement was achieved in most cases. Following an
   initial period of rapid crack tip acceleration up to terminal velocities
   well below the Rayleigh wave speed, subsequent propagation took place at
   a constant rate under conditions of increasing energy flux to an
   expanding process region. In addition, attempted and successful
   branching was predicted for the shorter notches. It was found that the
   shape of the cohesive law had a significant influence on the dynamic
   fracture behaviour. In particular, the value of the initial slope of the
   softening function was found to be an important parameter. As the slope
   became steeper, the predicted terminal crack speed increased and the
   extent of the damage decreased. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We analyse the relations between a viscoelastic damage rheology model
   and rate- and state-dependent (RS) friction. Both frameworks describe
   brittle deformation, although the former models localization zones in a
   deforming volume while the latter is associated with sliding on existing
   surfaces. The viscoelastic damage model accounts for evolving elastic
   properties and inelastic strain. The evolving elastic properties are
   related quantitatively to a damage state variable representing the local
   density of microcracks. Positive and negative changes of the damage
   variable lead, respectively, to degradation and recovery of the material
   in response to loading. A model configuration having an existing narrow
   zone with localized damage produces for appropriate loading and
   temperature-pressure conditions an overall cyclic stick slip motion
   compatible with a frictional response. Each deformation cycle ( limit
   cycle) can be divided into healing and weakening periods associated with
   decreasing and increasing damage, respectively. The direct effect of the
   RS friction and the magnitude of the frictional parameter a are related
   to material strengthening with increasing rate of loading. The strength
   and residence time of asperities ( model elements) in the weakening
   stage depend on the rates of damage evolution and accumulation of
   irreversible strain. The evolutionary effect of the RS friction and
   overall change in the friction parameters (a - b) are controlled by the
   duration of the healing period and asperity ( element) strengthening
   during this stage. For a model with spatially variable properties, the
   damage rheology reproduces the logarithmic dependency of the
   steady-state friction coefficient on the sliding velocity and the normal
   stress. The transition from a velocity strengthening regime to a
   velocity weakening one can be obtained by varying the rate of inelastic
   strain accumulation and keeping the other damage rheology parameters
   fixed. The developments unify previous damage rheology results on
   deformation localization leading to formation of new fault zones with
   detailed experimental results on frictional sliding. The results provide
   a route for extending the formulation of RS friction into a non-linear
   continuum mechanics framework.}},

Abstract = {{An investigation is undertaken to examine the residual mechanical
   properties of crowfoot-weave carbon/epoxy laminates subjected to a
   transverse central low-velocity impact load. It is found that the
   residual strength and stiffness of impacted laminates decrease with
   increasing impact damage area. Experimental data indicates that flexural
   stress constitutes the basis of a failure criterion that also describes
   damage severity, if localized damage at the region of impact is not
   serious. By formulating a simple model involving the motion of a rigid
   impactor, together with fundamental stress analysis of a transversely
   loaded plate, the effects of impactor mass, impact velocity, impactor
   tip radius, laminate thickness and lay-up on low-velocity impact damage
   are identified. Based on the experimental observations, it is found that
   the residual mechanical properties can be approximated by a linear
   relationship with a single damage severity parameter Q, where Q is a
   function of incident impact energy, impactor tip radius and laminate
   thickness. The theoretical results are verified by experimental data.

Abstract = {{During its service life, an aircraft is subjected to sever structural
   and aerodynamic loads. These loads can cause damage or weakening of the
   structure especially for aging military and civilian aircraft thereby
   affecting its load carrying capabilities. Hence, a repair or
   reinforcement of the damaged or weakened part of the structure to
   restore the structural efficiency and thus assure the continued
   airworthiness of the aircraft has become an important issue in recent
   years to military and civilian aircraft operators. The US Air Force in
   recent years has shown considerable interest in the use of advanced
   composites to repair cracked metallic aircraft structures to enhance
   their life. One issue preventing using bonded composite patches, as a
   standard means of repairing damaged metallic aircraft structures is the
   fact that the integrity of the repairs is unknown. In this paper the
   design, analysis and durability of adhesively bonded composite patch
   repairs of cracked aircraft aluminum panels is reported. Pre-cracked
   2024-T3 clad aluminum panels of 381 x 89 x 1.6 mm (15 x 3.5 x 0.063 in.)
   repaired with octagonal single sided boron/epoxy composite patch were
   used as test specimen. Two different composite ply configurations, 5-
   and 6-ply were investigated. Linear and non-linear finite element
   analyses were performed on the test specimen using 8-noded 24 degree of
   freedom (DOF) hexagonal elements for the aluminum panel, boron/epoxy
   patch and adhesive material subjected to uni-axial tensile loading. The
   stress distributions obtained were used to predict the increase in
   strength and durability of the repaired structure. A comparison of the
   stress values at critical points was made. The analysis also was used to
   validate various assumptions made in the design of the composite patch.
   Experimental investigations were conducted on the cracked aluminum panel
   repaired with a 5-ply composite patch as well as on two
   baseline-unpatched panels (one with a crack and one with no crack) by
   uni-axial tensile testing to validate the analytical results. The
   experiment was conducted on the Instron tension-testing machine. It was
   found that the maximum skin stress decreases significantly after the
   application of the patch and the region of maximum skin stress shifts
   from the crack front for an unpatched panel to the patch edges for a
   patched one. (C) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A study was made of radial crack evolution in curved brittle layers on
   compliant support substrates. Three-dimensional boundary element
   analysis was used to compute the stepwise growth of radial cracks that
   initiate at the bottom surfaces of glass on polymeric support layers,
   from initiation to final failure. The algorithm calculates reconstituted
   displacement fields in the near-tip region of the extending cracks,
   enabling direct evaluation of stress-intensity factors. Available
   experimental data on the same material systems with prescribed surface
   curvatures were used to validate the essential features of the predicted
   crack evolution, particularly the stability conditions prior to ultimate
   failure. It was shown that the critical loads to failure diminish with
   increasing surface curvature. Generalization of the ensuing fracture
   mechanics to include alternative brittle-layer/polymer-substrate systems
   enabled an explicit expression for the critical load to failure in terms
   of material properties and layer thicknesses. Implications concerning
   practical layer systems, particularly dental crowns, are briefly
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Structural health monitoring techniques based on vibration data have
   received increasing attention in recent years. Since the measured modal
   characteristics and the transient motion of a beam exhibit low
   sensitivity to damage, numerical techniques for accurately computing
   vibration characteristics are needed. Here we use a Meshless Local
   Petrov-Galerkin (MLPG) method to analyze vibrations of a beam with
   multiple cracks. The trial and the test functions are constructed using
   the Generalized Moving Least Squares (GMLS) approximation. The
   smoothness of the GMLS basis functions requires the use of special
   techniques to account for the slope dis-continuities at the crack
   locations. Therefore, a set of Lagrange multipliers is introduced to
   model the spring effects at the crack locations and relate motions of
   the intact beam segments. The method is applied to study static and
   transient deformations of a cracked beam and to determine its modal
   properties (frequencies and mode shapes). Numerical results obtained for
   a simply supported beam are compared with experimental findings,
   analytical predictions and finite element solutions.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work is experimental characterisation and
   numerical modelling of coupled behaviours between drying shrinkage and
   plastic damage in concrete. In the first part, we present an original
   experimental study on an ordinary concrete in order to determine
   material damage induced by drying shrinkage. Uniaxial compression tests
   are performed on samples dried for different periods. It is shown that
   material damage can be caused by drying process. Mechanical behaviour
   becomes more brittle with higher damage kinetics when concrete is dried.
   In the second part, a constitutive model is proposed in order to
   describe coupled hydro-mechanical behaviour of partially saturated
   concrete. This model takes into account induced damage, mechanical and
   capillary plastic deformations. Numerical simulations of experimental
   tests are presented, and show a qualitatively good agreement with
   experimental data. The results are relevant with respect to the
   importance of drying process in the durability study of concrete
   structures.

Abstract = {{In this investigation a general relationship between fatigue crack
   growth rate, da/dN, and a two-parameter Delta K and K-max driving force
   is derived using fundamental fatigue (epsilon-N curve) properties. A
   power-law relationship between Delta K and K-max is obtained by relating
   the crack growth rate to the fatigue life of the `process zone'.
   Theoretically, there are four different regions on a log-log plot
   depending on the particular combinations of Delta K and K-max. The
   actual analysis of experimental data indicates only two different
   regions namely, Delta K and K-max dominated, corresponding to high and
   low load ratios, respectively. A new way of representing the da/dN data
   in terms of Delta K and K-max by means of the crack propagation (CP)
   table is proposed. Finally, the application of the CP table for
   predicting crack growth rate under constant amplitude loading is
   explained and discussed. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},
