Abstract = {{The fracture of metallic glasses has received relatively little
   attention until recently. The development of bulk metallic glasses
   (BMGs) with more compositions, large sample sizes and diverse fracture
   behaviors provides a series of ideal model systems for the study of
   fracture in glassy materials. The fracture toughness of different BMGs
   varies significantly from approaching ideally brittle to the highest
   known damage tolerance. Diverse fracture patterns on the fracture
   surface, fracture modes and dynamic propagation of cracks have been
   observed in different BMGs. In this review paper, we present a
   comprehensive view of the state-of-the-art research on various aspects
   of the fracture of BMGs, including fracture behavior and
   characteristics, fracture mode, fracture criterion, fracture toughness,
   and fracture morphology. Accumulated experimental data on BMG fracture
   are presented and their possible theoretical connections with continuum
   fracture mechanics and the atomic-scale process are introduced and
   discussed. Modeling studies of the fracture of BMGs by various
   computational methods are also reviewed. The review also presents a
   number of perspectives, including the relation of BMG fracture study to
   other topics, and unsolved issues for future investigation. (C) 2015

Volume = {{55}},

Abstract = {{In this contribution we address the issue of efficient finite element
   treatment for phase-field modeling of brittle fracture. We start by
   providing an overview of the existing quasi-static and dynamic
   phase-field fracture formulations from the physics and the mechanics
   communities. Within the formulations stemming from Griffith's theory, we
   focus on quasi-static models featuring a tension-compression split,
   which prevent cracking in compression and interpenetration of the crack
   faces upon closure, and on the staggered algorithmic implementation due
   to its proved robustness. In this paper, we establish an appropriate
   stopping criterion for the staggered scheme. Moreover, we propose and
   test the so-called hybrid formulation, which leads within a staggered
   implementation to an incrementally linear problem. This enables a
   significant reduction of computational cost-about one order of
   magnitude-with respect to the available (non-linear) models. The
   conceptual and structural similarities of the hybrid formulation to
   gradient-enhanced continuum damage mechanics are outlined as well.
   Several benchmark problems are solved, including one with own
   experimental verification.}},

Title = {{Effect of core-shell rubber (CSR) nano-particles on mechanical
   properties and fracture toughness of an epoxy polymer}},
Journal = {{POLYMER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{66}},
Pages = {{16-28}},

Abstract = {{A DGEBA epoxy resin cured using dicyandiamide hardener, was modified by
   using two types of CSR nano-particles over a range of volume fractions
   from 0 vol.\% to 38 vol.\%. The size and microstructure of CSR particles
   were studied and the measured diameters are 203 nm (with a 16.9 nm shell
   thickness) and 74.1 nm respectively. Addition of CSR nano particles
   increased the glass transition temperature due to the interaction
   between matrix and particles. Addition of CSR particles increased the
   ductility and Poisson's ratio of epoxy, but reduced the Young's modulus
   and tensile strength. Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio and tensile
   strength were well predicted by theoretical models using an effective
   volume fraction of rubber. An optimum CSR content was found to exist,
   when the fracture energy increased from 343 J/m(2) for matrix to 2671
   J/m(2) for epoxy modified by 30 vol.\% of CSR particles, and then
   started to decline. The main toughening mechanisms were proved to be
   debonding of CSR particles from matrix, followed by plastic voids
   growth, which was accompanied by shear bands yielding. Large-scale
   plastic void growth was discovered at the subcritical tip of double
   notch four points bending test (DN-4PB), and the values of fracture
   energy were found to be proportional to the size of plastic damage zone
   measured from subcritical crack tip of DN-4PB. This proved the plastic
   void growth is the major toughening mechanism, which correlated well
   with the results of fracture energy modelling. A theoretical model was
   used to predict the fracture toughness increment due to the shear band
   yielding and plastic void growth. The analytical values showed good
   agreement with the experimental data, and further demonstrated the
   proposed toughening mechanism. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This research is related to a signal processing of full wavefield data
   as an effective tool for detection, localization and visualization of a
   crack growth in thin-walled structures. Full wavefield data of
   propagating Lamb waves in structures such as plates and shells made out
   of metallic alloys and composite laminates contain a wealth of
   information about wave pattern anomalies due to occurrence of a damage.
   The aim is to demonstrate a method for enhancing damage visualization in
   structures such that estimation of the length and orientation of the
   crack can be easily obtained. The proposed signal processing involves
   application of discrete fast Fourier transform, wavenumber domain
   filtering and inverse discrete Fourier transform. The method is further
   enhanced by a technique for compensation of the wave attenuation so that
   the effects of structural damage have the same influence regardless of
   the location. The concept is first illustrated on numerically simulated
   data, and then tested on experimental results. In the experiments, full
   wavefield measurements are obtained using a scanning laser Doppler
   vibrometer, which allows the measurement of displacements and/or
   velocities along three axes over a user-defined grid. In the proposed
   method only out-of-plane velocities are used. Tests performed on simple
   aluminum and composite plates with artificially introduced longitudinal
   cracks confirm the effectiveness of the method and its potential for
   application to the inspection of a variety of structural components. (C)

Abstract = {{A novel meshless numerical method, called general particle dynamics
   (GPD), is proposed to simulate samples of rock-like brittle
   heterogeneous material containing four preexisting flaws under uniaxial
   compressive loads. Numerical simulations are conducted to investigate
   the initiation, growth, and coalescence of cracks using a GPD code. An
   elasto-brittle damage model based on an extension of the Hoek-Brown
   strength criterion is applied to reflect crack initiation, growth, and
   coalescence and the macrofailure of the rock-like material. The
   preexisting flaws are simulated by empty particles. The particle is
   killed when its stresses satisfy the Hoek-Brown strength criterion, and
   the growth path of cracks is captured through the sequence of such
   damaged particles. A statistical approach is applied to model the
   heterogeneity of the rock-like material. It is found from the numerical
   results that samples containing four preexisting flaws may produce five
   types of cracks at or near the tips of preexisting flaws including wing,
   coplanar or quasi-coplanar secondary, oblique secondary, out-of-plane
   tensile, and out-of-plane shear cracks. Four coalescence modes are
   observed from the numerical results: tensile (T), compression (C), shear
   (S), and mixed tension/shear (TS). A higher load is required to induce
   crack coalescence in the shear mode (S) than the tensile (T) or mixed
   (TS) mode. It is concluded from the numerical results that crack
   coalescence occurs following the weakest coalescence path among all
   possible paths between any two flaws. The numerical results are in good
   agreement with reported experimental observations.}},

Volume = {{71}},

Abstract = {{Low-velocity impact damage can drastically reduce the residual strength
   of a composite structure even when the damage is barely visible. The
   ability to computationally predict the extent of damage and
   compression-after-impact (CAI) strength of a composite structure can
   potentially lead to the exploration of a larger design space without
   incurring significant time and cost penalties. A high-fidelity
   three-dimensional composite damage model, to predict both low-velocity
   impact damage and CAI strength of composite laminates, has been
   developed and implemented as a user material subroutine in the
   commercial finite element package, ABAQUS/Explicit. The intralaminar
   damage model component accounts for physically-based tensile and
   compressive failure mechanisms, of the fibres and matrix, when subjected
   to a three-dimensional stress state. Cohesive behaviour was employed to
   model the interlaminar failure between plies with a bi-linear
   traction-separation law for capturing damage onset and subsequent damage
   evolution. The virtual tests, set up in ABAQUS/Explicit, were executed
   in three steps, one to capture the impact damage, the second to
   stabilize the specimen by imposing new boundary conditions required for
   compression testing, and the third to predict the CAI strength. The
   observed intralaminar damage features, delamination damage area as well
   as residual strength are discussed. It is shown that the predicted
   results for impact damage and CAI strength correlated well with
   experimental testing without the need of model calibration which is
   often required with other damage models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The effect of stress state and loading path on the ductile fracture of
   aluminum 2024-T351 is characterized through tension-torsion experiments
   on tubular specimens. The experimental program includes proportional and
   non-proportional loading paths leading to the onset of fracture at
   nearly plane stress conditions at stress triaxialities between 0 and
   0.6. Stereo digital image correlation is used to measure the
   displacements and rotations applied to the specimen shoulders. An
   isotropic non-quadratic Hosford plasticity model with combined
   Voce-Swift hardening is used to obtain estimates of the local stress and
   strain fields within the specimen gage section. The hybrid
   experimental-numerical results indicate a higher strain to fracture for
   pure shear than for uniaxial tension. The calibration of a
   Hosford-Coulomb fracture initiation model suggests that the ductility of
   aluminum 2024-T351 decreases monotonically as a function of the stress
   triaxiality, whereas it is a non-symmetric convex function of the Lode
   angle parameter. It is shown that a simple non-linear damage
   accumulation rule can describe the effect of non-proportional loading on
   the strain to fracture. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Inelastic deformation and damage evolution at microdefects are two
   essential nonlinear mechanisms that govern macroscopic mechanical
   behaviors of quasi-brittle solids. The present paper deals in a unified
   framework with two dissipative processes in microcracks: inelastic
   deformation due to frictional sliding and damage by crack growth,
   usually arising and strongly coupled in cohesive materials under
   compression. Contributions by this work are threefold: (i) based on the
   Mod-Tanaka method, the free enthalpy of the representative elementary
   volume composed of a matrix phase and randomly oriented and distributed
   penny-shaped microcracks is determined for the general case of multiple
   crack families. The constitutive formulations are now presented in an
   elegant manner by using two orientation-dependent tensorial operators;
   (ii) the friction criterion is formulated in terms of the local stress
   applied onto microcracks. This local stress contains a back stress term
   that allows unified modeling of material hardening/softening behavior:
   friction-induced hardening is attributed to the cumulation of frictional
   shearing while damage-related softening is induced by crack growth and
   coalescence; (iii) originally, strength prediction is achieved through
   damage-friction coupling analyses. In that process, a basic feature of
   the damage resistance is revealed, leading to a novel damage criterion
   suitable for describing and modeling nonlinear mechanical behavior of
   quasi-brittle materials. Moreover, trans-scale relationship between the
   parameters in the local criteria and experimental data from laboratory
   tests is set up, which is always appealing in multiscale modeling. As a
   first phase of validation, the refined micromechanical model is finally
   applied to simulate laboratory tests on a granite under triaxial
   compression. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{122}},
Pages = {{507-517}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Despite the recent success of modeling progressive damage of open-hole
   fiber reinforced composites subjected to tension (OHT), it is still a
   challenging task to predict the strengths and the damage progression of
   open-hole composite laminates under compressive loading (OHC). Herein,
   we propose a progressive damage model for OHC based on our early model
   for OHT and apply it to study the size effects of OHC. In the proposed
   model, continuum shell elements are used to account for both in-plane
   and out-of-plane deformation and delamination is modeled using cohesive
   elements. A smeared crack model is used to model the progressive failure
   of composite plies. It is found that the proposed model can predict
   accurately the experimental strengths and damage patterns with the
   assumption that the translaminar fracture toughness for blocked plies
   increases. The different failure mechanisms of the sublaminate scaled
   laminates of the stacking sequence {[}45/90/ - 45/0](ms) and the
   ply-level scaled laminates of stacking sequence {[}45(n)/90(n)/ -
   45(n)/0(n)](s) are found to be closely related to the in-plane shear
   stress of the central 0 degrees ply block and the initiation of
   interface delamination. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The modeling of progressive delamination by means of a discrete damage
   zone model within the extended finite element method is investigated.
   This framework allows for both bulk and interface damages to be
   conveniently traced, regardless of the underlying mesh alignment. For
   discrete interfaces, a new mixed-mode force-separation relation, which
   accounts for the coupled interaction between opening and sliding modes,
   is proposed. The model is based on the concept of Continuum Damage
   Mechanics and is shown to be thermodynamically consistent. An
   integral-type nonlocal damage is adopted in the bulk to regularize the
   softening material response. The resulting nonlinear equations are
   solved using a Newton scheme with a dissipation-based arc-length
   constraint, for which an analytical Jacobian is derived. Several
   benchmark delamination studies, as well as failure analyses of a
   fiber/epoxy unit cell, are presented and discussed in detail. The
   proposed model is validated against available analytical/experimental
   data and is found to be robust and mesh insensitive.}},

Abstract = {{Rail tread oblique crack, initiated by rolling contact fatigue (RCF)
   damage, is one of the most significant phenomena and has serious
   influence on rail industry. Electromagnetic non-destructive testing (EM
   NDT) methods are usually used in rail regular inspection. However, the
   conventional EM NDT methods based on eddy current field distribution are
   difficult to detect the cracks parallel to the inductive coil (parallel
   cracks) and natural oblique cracks. This paper studied lateral heat
   conduction (LHC) induced by eddy current for detection of these defects.
   The proposed method was verified through both numerical and experimental
   studies as well as the investigation of characteristic of LHC. Due to
   significant temperature gradient in the direction of lateral heat
   conduction, the spatial derivative and gradient were proposed to improve
   the defect detectability on the thermo-grams. Finally, the test of
   natural oblique cracks on a rail was conducted to validate the proposed
   methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study atomic force microscopy (AFM) creep indentations were

   were used to perform finite element (FE) simulations to study the effect
   of bitumen microstructure on internal stress distribution. FE analyses
   suggest that microstructures with varying mechanical properties cause
   localised stress amplification that can lead to cracking/phase
   separation. A custom-made loading frame in conjunction with an AFM was
   used to examine the effects of tensile strain on bitumen microstructure.
   FE simulation and experimental results show that applying strain
   resulted in damage/phase separation concentrated in the interstitial
   zone between neighbouring bee structures, defined as load-induced phase
   separation. This study suggests that evaluating the bitumen
   microstructure and microrheology is critical to understanding the

   subsurface damage in brittle material grinding}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS \& MANUFACTURE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{12-23}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The external interference and vibration can seriously affect the
   machining errors in brittle materials grinding process. This paper
   proposes a new model to analyze the relationship between surface
   roughness (SR) and subsurface damage (SSD) depth on the basis of
   grinding kinematics analysis and indentation fracture mechanics of
   brittle materials taking the wheel spindle vibration into account. The
   basic equations, for example, equations of grain trajectory and
   penetration depth are derived in new forms. Based on the basic equations
   above, the existing SR and SSD formulae are modified for further study.
   The effects of grinding and vibration parameters on SR and SSD are
   respectively analyzed in detail. Results show that both SR and SSD
   increase with the increase of table speed and vibration amplitude
   resulting in bad surface and subsurface quality. On the other hand, both
   the increasing grinding speed and decreasing vibration frequency can
   improve the quality of ground surface and subsurface with small SR and
   SSD. In addition, the increase of initial grinding depth and vibration
   initial phase increase the depth of SSD but have little effect on SR.
   The penetration depth and distance between grain's tip and finished
   surface are the two main factors considered to cause the different
   effect laws on SR and SSD among these parameters. Experiment is carried
   out to validate the rationality of proposed model. The effect trends of
   various grinding parameters on SR obtained by our model consist with
   measured experimental data. The typical subsurface crack system is
   clearly revealed through the experimental observation on SSD using SEM.
   Finally, the relationship between the two is fitted utilizing quadratic
   polynomial. Results show that the SSD depth is nonlinear monotone
   increasing with SR and the fitting accuracy is more or less affected by
   both grinding and vibration parameters. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In the present study, an evaluation method for the initial and
   progressive failure of composite laminates was proposed based on the
   Puck failure criterion and damage mechanics, respectively. In other
   words, the initial failure (crack initiation in the fiber and/or matrix)
   and progressive failure (crack growth in the fiber and/or matrix) were
   evaluated using the Puck failure criterion, and fiber- and
   matrix-dependent damage variables, respectively. In addition, the ABAQUS
   user-defined subroutine UMAT was developed based on coupling theories
   for the failure criterion and damage mechanics in order to efficiently
   analyze the progressive failure phenomenon in glass/carbon
   fiber-reinforced composite laminates. The developed subroutine was
   applied to the failure of industrial composite laminates, and the
   analysis results were compared to the experimental/numerical results
   previously reported in the literature. This comparative study confirmed
   that the simulation results were in good agreement with the reported
   composite failure results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Determination of minimum CFRP pre-stress levels for fatigue crack
   prevention in retrofitted metallic beams}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{84}},
Pages = {{29-41}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{The majority of fatigue strengthening studies focus on reducing
   propagation rates of existing cracks, ignoring the crack initiation
   stage. Many existing metallic bridge members however do not contain
   existing cracks, but rather are nearing their design fatigue life.
   Limited research exists on the prevention of crack initiation using
   carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) materials. In this paper,
   constant life diagrams (CLDs) are used to determine the minimum level of
   CFRP pre-stress required to indefinitely extend the fatigue life of
   existing metallic beams. It is shown that by applying a compressive
   force to an existing fatigue-susceptible detail using pre-stressed CFRP
   plates, the mean stress level can be reduced such that the detail is
   shifted from the `finite life' regime to the `infinite life' regime. The
   proposed fatigue strengthening approach is advantageous particularly
   when the stress history from the prior traffic loadings is not known. To
   validate the proposed method, a pre-stressed un-bonded CFRP
   reinforcement system is introduced and tested on four metallic beams.
   The proposed un-bonded CFRP system is advantageous over traditional
   bonded CFRP systems as it can be applied to rough or obstructed surfaces
   (surfaces containing rivet heads or corrosion pitting for example).
   Additionally, the new un-bonded CFRP system offers a fast on-site
   installation (no glue and surface preparation are required) and an
   adaptive pre-stress level. Experimental results show that strengthening
   using pre-stressed CFRP plates are capable of shifting the working
   stresses from a finite fatigue-life zone to an infinite fatigue-life
   zone preventing crack initiation. Although according to many structural
   standards, the stress range is the main parameter that affects the
   fatigue life of a metallic detail, the results of this study clearly
   show that the mean stress level also plays a significant rule in the
   detail fatigue life. Based on the proposed CLD approach in this paper,
   the combined effects of the stress range and mean stress level can be
   taken into account for prediction of fatigue life of metallic members.

Title = {{Laser ablation of titanium alloy under a thin and flowing water layer}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS \& MANUFACTURE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{89}},
Pages = {{14-28}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Underwater laser ablation has become an alternative machining process
   that is able to reduce the thermal damage in work materials caused by
   lasers. However, the disturbance of water to the laser beam is a crucial
   concern for the ablation performance in water and cut surface quality
   obtained. In this study, a new laser ablation technique has been
   proposed, in which a waterjet was applied to impinge the top workpiece
   surface in order to form a thin and flowing water layer. With the assist
   of such water layer during the laser ablation, the redeposition and
   heat-affected zone can be minimized. Titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) selected
   as a work sample was grooved by using a nanosecond-pulse laser under
   different machining conditions. The cut geometry and heat-affected zone
   were observed and analyzed to justify the process performance. The
   metallurgical change and cracks that occurred on and underneath the
   groove surface were also investigated in this study. The experimental
   results revealed that a clean cut with less thermal damage can be
   obtained when the workpiece was ablated by a laser under the flowing
   water layer. In addition, a narrower and deeper groove can be fabricated
   when a higher waterjet flow rate was applied. The laser ablation under
   the flowing water layer developed in this study could be a potential
   method for machining titanium alloy or even other thermal-sensitive
   materials. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Silicon carbide ceramics are generally used in armour configurations for
   the foot-soldier or military vehicles. However, their behaviour during
   impact is not fully understood. In this work, the dynamic fragmentation
   of silicon carbide has been characterised through different impact
   configurations: Edge-on impact tests and normal impact tests have been
   conducted in open and sarcophagus configuration. In the first
   configuration, an ultra-high speed camera is used to visualise the
   fragmentation process with an interframe time set to 1 pis. The
   sarcophagus configuration provides a post-mortem view of the damage
   pattern. Moreover, a comparison with numerical results given by an
   anisotropic damage model shows a good capacity to predict the damage
   patterns and the cracking densities of the ceramic after impact but also
   the damage kinetics observed during impact. In addition, an original
   impact configuration is proposed for characterising the dynamic
   behaviour of a pre-fragmented ceramic. The tests have been compared to
   experiments performed with a plane aluminium alloy target. The results
   underline the good penetration resistance of the fragmented ceramic. (C)

Title = {{Prediction of fretting fatigue crack initiation in double lap bolted
   joint using Continuum Damage Mechanics}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{66-76}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In fretting fatigue, the combination of small oscillatory motion, normal
   pressure and cyclic axial loading develops a noticeable stress
   concentration at the contact zone leading to accumulation of damage in
   fretted region, which produces micro cracks, and consequently forms a
   leading crack that can lead to failure. In fretting fatigue experiments,
   it is very difficult to detect the crack initiation phase. Damages and
   cracks are always hidden between the counterpart surfaces. Therefore,
   numerical modeling techniques for analyzing fretting fatigue crack
   initiation provide a precious tool to study this phenomenon. This
   article gives an insight in fretting fatigue crack initiation. This is
   done by means of an experimental set up and numerical models developed
   with the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software package ABAQUS. Using
   Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) approach in conjunction with FEA, an
   uncoupled damage evolution law is used to model fretting fatigue crack
   initiation lifetime of Double Bolted Lap Joint (DBLJ). The predicted
   fatigue lifetimes are in good agreement with the experimentally measured
   ones. This comparison provides insight to the contribution of damage
   initiation and crack propagation in the total fatigue lifetime of DBLJ
   test specimens. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ROCK MECHANICS AND ROCK ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{509-526}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Theoretical and experimental studies have revealed that energy
   dissipation and release play an important role in the deformation and
   failure of coal rocks. To determine the relationship between energy
   transformation and coal failure, the mechanical behaviors of coal
   specimens taken from a 600-m deep mine were investigated by conventional
   triaxial compression tests using five different confining pressures.
   Each coal specimen was scanned by microfocus computed tomography before
   and after testing to examine the crack patterns. Sieve analysis was used
   to measure the post-failure coal fragments, and a fractal model was
   developed for describing the size distribution of the fragments. Based
   on the test results, a damage evolution model of the rigidity
   degeneration of coal before the peak strength was also developed and
   used to determine the initial damage and critical damage variables. It
   was found that the peak strength increased with increasing confining
   pressure, but the critical damage variable was almost invariant. More
   new cracks were initiated in the coal specimens when there was no
   confining pressure or the pressure was too high. The parameters of
   failure energy ratio beta and stress drop coefficient alpha are further
   proposed to describe the failure mode of coal under different confining
   pressures. The test results revealed that beta was approximately
   linearly related to the fractal dimension of the coal fragments and that
   a higher failure energy ratio corresponded to a larger fractal dimension
   and more severe failure. The stress drop coefficient alpha decreased
   approximately exponentially with increasing confining pressure, and
   could be used to appropriately describe the evolution of the coal
   failure mode from brittle to ductile with increasing confining pressure.
   A large beta and small alpha under a high confining pressure were
   noticed during the tests, which implied that the failure of the coal was
   a kind of pseudo-ductile failure. Brittle failure occurred when the
   confining pressure was unloaded-an observation that is important for the
   safety assessment of deep mines, where a high in situ stress might
   result in brittle failure of the coal seam, or sudden outburst.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of temperature on the mechanical behaviour of Strathbogie
   granite (fine-grained) was studied under unconfined stress conditions.
   Fracturing behaviour of test specimens was studied using an acoustic
   emission (AE) detection system and some crack propagation was also
   performed using electron microscopy scanning (SEM). The stress-strain
   curves showed plastic and post-peak behaviour for temperatures above 800
   degrees C and the brittle-plastic transition was observed to occur
   between 600 and 800 degrees C for the uniaxially tested Strathbogie
   granite at a strain rate of 0.1 mm/min and room humidity. Specimens were
   heated at a rate of 5 degrees C/min with a 1 h holding period before
   testing. The AE results showed that the increasing temperature reduces
   the stress thresholds for crack initiation and crack damage and extends
   the duration of stable crack propagation. Prevalence of ductile
   properties with increasing temperature was also observed from AE
   results. The stress-strain and AE results reveal that the failure modes
   of Strathbogie granite specimens changed from brittle fracturing to
   quasi-brittle shear fracturing and eventually to ductile failure with
   increasing temperature. Temperature was observed to influence the colour
   of granite, and the initial white/grey colour changed to an oxidated
   reddish colour with increasing temperature. The stress-strain data of
   tested specimens were incorporated into a finite element model (ABAQUS
   6.7.1), so that both plastic and ductile behaviour of the Strathbogie
   granite could be predicted over a wide range of temperatures. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{In this paper, the stress-regime dependent creep model and ductility
   have been implemented in a ductility exhaustion based damage model, and
   their influence on creep crack growth (CCG) behavior of materials have
   been analyzed. By using the stress-regime dependent creep model and
   ductility, the CCG rate in a Cr-Mo-V steel over a wide range of C{*} has
   been predicted by finite element analyses. The predicted CCG rates agree
   with the available experimental data in the literature. The analysis
   results show that with increasing C{*}, the creep model and ductility
   for determining crack-tip creep damage accumulation change from the
   low-stress regime model and ductility through a combination of low- and
   high-stress regime model and ductility to high-stress regime model and
   ductility. These changes lead to the line segments of the da/dt-C{*}
   curves. In CCG life analyses and designs of high temperature components,
   the stress-regime dependent creep model and ductility need to be used.

Abstract = {{Many efforts have been made to understand the effects of hydrogen on
   steels, resulting in an abundance of theoretical models and papers.
   However, a fully developed and practically applicable predictive
   physical model still does not exist industrially for predicting and
   preventing hydrogen damage. In practice, it is observed that different
   types of damages to industrial boiler components have been associated
   with the presence and localization of hydrogen in metals. In this paper,
   a damaged boiler tube made of grade 20 - St. 20 (or 20G, equivalent to
   AISI 1020) was investigated. The experimental research was conducted in
   two distinctive phases: failure analysis of the boiler evaporator tube
   sample and subsequent postmortem analysis of the viable hydrogen
   embrittlement mechanisms (HE) in St. 20 steel. Numerous tested samples
   were cut out from the boiler tubes of fossil fuel power plant, damaged
   due to high temperature hydrogen attack (HTHA) during service, as a
   result of the development of hydrogen-induced corrosion process. Samples
   were prepared for the chemical composition analysis, tube wall thickness
   measurement, tensile testing, hardness measurement, impact strength
   testing (on instrumented Charpy machine), analysis of the chemical
   composition of corrosion products - deposit and the microstructural
   characterization by optical and scanning electron microscopy SEM/EDX.
   The HTHA damage mechanism is a primary cause of boiler tube fracture.
   Based on the multi-scale special model, applied in subsequent postmortem
   investigations, the results indicate a simultaneous action of the
   hydrogen-enhanced decohesion (HEDE) and hydrogen-enhanced localized
   plasticity (HELP) mechanisms of HE, depending on the local concentration
   of hydrogen in investigated steel. The model is based on the correlation
   of mechanical properties to the SEM fractography analysis of fracture
   surfaces. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In steel-concrete composite girders, innovative composite dowels can be
   used to transfer the shear forces between the concrete slab and the
   steel section. Today, composite dowels are predominately used in
   engineering structures such as prefabricated composite bridges. However,
   due to their ease of manufacture, good loadbearing and deformation
   properties and suitability for slender concrete slabs, these composite
   dowels are being used more than ever in building construction as well.
   The present article describes shear tests on puzzle-shaped composite
   dowels for slender concrete slabs with a depth of only 10 cm. Aside from
   different reinforcement configurations, the influence of different
   longitudinal stress states and transverse cracking in the concrete slab
   have been investigated. In previous studies of the shear force capacity
   of composite dowels, the influence of transverse cracking has been
   neglected. However, our own experiments described in this paper show
   that the shear capacity of composite dowels is significantly affected by
   concrete cracking. In order to simulate the experiments performed and to
   analyse the shear behaviour of the composite dowels in cracked and
   uncracked concrete, a three-dimensional, non-linear finite element model
   of the shear tests was set up. The results of both the experimental and
   numerical investigations are summarized in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Localized infrared (IR) laser heating of fused silica optics has proven
   highly effective in reducing or removing surface flaws, which tend to
   limit performance in high power laser systems. Here, we present both
   simulation and experimental results to examine the use of IR laser light
   to polish, anneal, and micro-shape fused silica surfaces used in high
   power laser systems. We show how the resulting material response can be
   tuned by considering the temperature-dependent optical constants of the
   material and choosing the appropriate laser parameter set. For example,
   non-evaporative laser polishing of glass surfaces to heal crack networks
   is shown most effective when using mid-IR lasers, which lead to laser
   energy coupling up to approximate to 1mm in depth. In contrast,
   long-wave IR light tuned to the Restrahlen frequency of the material is
   shown to evaporate material most efficiently with penetration depths of
   <1m. Through calibrated, time-resolved thermal imaging we are able to
   monitor the laser polishing process, to control material response. The
   results of our studies can be applied beyond the practical application
   of damage mitigation in high energy pulsed laser systems to any which
   require laser-smoothing and shaping of silica surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the crucial significance of failure prediction in composites,
   such an objective remains challenging, even in unidirectional (UD)
   systems. A strength model for UD composites was used that has great
   versatility in handling various matrix and fibre behaviours. This model
   includes a simplified superposition principle that was found to be
   reliable in predicting stress concentration factors irrespective of the
   presence of matrix cracks. The model revealed the negligible influence
   of matrix cracks on stress concentrations, ineffective length, cluster
   development and failure strain. The presence of matrix cracks can
   therefore be safely neglected in models for UD composites. This
   information is important for experimental validations and for advancing
   the state of the art in strength models for UD composites. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This paper presents research on the response and behavior of both high
   strength concrete (107 MPa) and normal strength concrete (27.6 MPa)
   slabs doubly reinforced with high strength low alloy vanadium (HSLA-V)
   reinforcement (VR) and conventional steel reinforcing bars (NR)
   subjected to explosive loads. Four types of reinforced concrete (RC)
   slabs namely High Strength Concrete (HSC) with HSLA-V Steel Reinforcing
   bars (HSC-VR), High Strength Concrete with Conventional Steel
   Reinforcing bars (HSC-NR), Normal Strength Concrete (NSC) with HSLA-V
   Steel Reinforcing bars (NSC-VR), and Normal Strength Concrete with
   Conventional Steel Reinforcing bars (NSC-NR) have been studied and
   compared both experimentally and numerically. The slabs were subjected
   to blast loads using a shock tube capable of generating both positive
   and negative phase pressures. Data collected during the dynamic
   experiments consisted of reflected pressure obtained from several
   pressure gages arranged along the perimeter of the test article and
   mid-span deflections captured from an accelerometer, a laser device, and
   high speed video. The numerical analysis was performed with the
   commercial program LS-DYNA using two material models. The concrete
   material models considered were Winfrith Concrete Model (WCM) and
   Concrete Damage Model Release 3 (CDMR3). Results from the numerical
   simulation are compared with the experimental values to determine
   material parameters and other finite element model related constraints.
   Mesh sensitivity and crack propagation studies were also conducted. From
   this study it was observed that CDMR3 and WCM can be used over a wider
   range of concrete compressive strengths. The advantages and
   disadvantages of using high strength materials are discussed. (C) 2014

   exposure to a chloride environment. Specimen beams that were cast in
   2010 were compared to specimens cast in 1984. The only differences
   between the two sets of beams were the casting direction in relation to
   tensile reinforcement and the exposure conditions in the salt-fog
   chamber. The cracking maps, corrosion maps, chloride profiles, and
   cross-sectional loss of one group of two beams cast in 2010 were studied
   and their calculated corrosion rates were compared to that of beams cast
   in 1984 in order to investigate the factors influencing the natural
   corrosion process. Experimental results show that, after rapid
   initiation of corrosion at the crack tip, the corrosion process
   practically halted and the time elapsing before corrosion resumed
   depended on the exposure conditions and cover depth. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Pages = {{59-98}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we review the peridynamic model for brittle fracture and
   use it to investigate crack branching in brittle homogeneous and
   isotropic materials. The peridynamic simulations offer a possible
   explanation for the generation of dynamic instabilities in dynamic
   brittle crack growth and crack branching. We focus on two systems, glass
   and homalite, often used in crack branching experiments. After a brief
   review of theoretical and computational models on crack branching, we
   discuss the peridynamic model for dynamic fracture in linear
   elastic-brittle materials. Three loading types are used to investigate
   the role of stress waves interactions on crack propagation and
   branching. We analyze the influence of sample geometry on branching.
   Simulation results are compared with experimental ones in terms of crack
   patterns, propagation speed at branching and branching angles. The
   peridynamic results indicate that as stress intensity around the crack
   tip increases, stress waves pile-up against the material directly in
   front of the crack tip that moves against the advancing crack; this
   process ``deflects{''} the strain energy away from the symmetry line and
   into the crack surfaces creating damage away from the crack line. This
   damage ``migration{''}, seen as roughness on the crack surface in
   experiments, modifies, in turn, the strain energy landscape around the
   crack tip and leads to preferential crack growth directions that branch
   from the original crack line. We argue that nonlocality of damage growth
   is one key feature in modeling of the crack branching phenomenon in
   brittle fracture. The results show that, at least to first order, no
   ingredients beyond linear elasticity and a capable damage model are
   necessary to explain/predict crack branching in brittle homogeneous and
   isotropic materials.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of z-pin length-on the mode I and mode II delamination
   toughness and fatigue resistance of z-pinned carbon-epoxy composites is
   investigated. Experimental testing and mechanical modelling reveals that
   both the mode I fracture toughness and fatigue resistance increase with
   the z-pin length due to increased bridging traction loads generated by
   elastic stretching and pull-out of the pins. The opposite trend occurs
   for mode II toughness, which decreases with increasing z-pin length due
   to lower traction loads arising from restrictions on the shear-induced
   rotation and pull-out of the pins. The mode II fatigue resistance is
   increased by z-pinning, although it is not dependent on the z-pin
   length. Increasing the z-pin length beyond a critical size also changes
   the mode I and mode II delamination fracture and fatigue processes from
   single to multiple cracking. The effect of z-pin length on the
   delamination toughening and fatigue strengthening mechanisms is

   mechanisms and life prediction}},
Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{341-356}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{The extremely-low-cycle fatigue (ELCF) behaviors of pure Cu and Cu-Al
   alloys are comprehensively studied following the cyclic push pull
   loading tests with extremely high strain amplitudes (up to +/- 9.5\%).
   Compared with the common low-cycle fatigue (LCF) region, several unique
   features in the ELCF regime can be noticed, including the deviations of
   fatigue life from the Coffin-Manson law, the non-negligible proportion
   occupied by the cyclic hardening stage of the whole fatigue life,
   special microstructures formed by cyclic loading containing deformation
   twins, shear bands and ultra-fine grains and the transformation of
   fatigue cracking modes. All these characteristics indicate the existence
   of special interior fatigue damage mechanisms of ELCF. To help discover
   the new damage mechanisms under ELCF, a model of fatigue life prediction
   with a hysteresis energy-based criterion is proposed. Based on the
   analysis of the experimental and modeling results, two intrinsic factors
   determining the ELCF properties were concluded: the capacity of ELCF
   damage, and the defusing and dispersion ability of the external
   mechanical work. The former can be evaluated by a parameter of the model
   called the intrinsic fatigue toughness W-0, which is related to the
   microstructure evolution condition, the cyclic hardening ability, the
   deformation homogeneity and possibly the static toughness. The latter
   can be represented by the damage transition exponent beta, which can be
   enhanced by improving the planarity, reversibility and uniformity of
   plastic deformation, reflecting the decline in the degree of surface
   damage and the dispersion of fatigue cracks. For Cu-Al alloys with
   increasing Al content, cooperation between an increasing damage capacity
   and a decreasing damage accumulation rate leads to a comprehensive
   improvement in the ELCF properties. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic guided waves are one of the primary methods being
   investigated for structural health monitoring of plate-like components.
   A common practice is to collect measurements from a sparse transducer
   array using the pitch-catch method, which enables interrogation of
   defects from multiple directions. Thus, knowledge of how guided waves
   scatter from defects is very useful for detection, localization, and
   characterization of damage. One way to describe scattering patterns is
   with a matrix indexed by incident angle and scattered angle, and sparse
   array measurements essentially sample this matrix. A methodology is
   proposed in this paper to estimate the complete scattering matrix from
   these limited array measurements. First, recorded array signals are
   compensated for geometric spreading loss, wave packet spreading loss,
   and transducer differences. Initial scattering values are then extracted
   from the scattered wave packets after baseline subtraction and are
   augmented using transducer reciprocity and any a priori knowledge of
   defect geometric symmetry. Finally, radial basis function interpolation
   is performed on these values to obtain the complete scattering matrix.
   Scattering matrices are generated from experimental data by cutting
   notches of different lengths originating from a through-hole in an
   aluminum plate specimen that is instrumented with a sparse transducer
   array. The methodology is validated by laser vibrometry measurements
   performed on a nominally identical specimen for one notch length.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestered in saline aquifers undergoes a variety
   of chemically-coupled mechanical effects, which may cause CO2-induced
   mechanical changes and time-dependent reservoir deformation. This paper
   investigates the mineralogical and microstructural changes that occur in
   reservoir rocks following injection of CO2 in deep saline aquifers and
   the manner in which these changes influence the mechanical properties of
   the reservoir rocks. In this study, cylindrical sandstone specimens, 38
   mm in diameter and 76 mm high, obtained from the Gosford basin, were
   used to perform a series of un-confined compressive strength (UCS)
   tests. Different saturation conditions: dry, water- and brine-saturated
   sandstone samples with and without scCO(2) (super-critical carbon
   dioxide) injection, were considered in the study to obtain a
   comprehensive understanding of the impact of scCO(2) injection during
   the CO2 sequestration process on saline aquifer mechanical properties.
   An acoustic emission (AE) system was employed to identify the stress
   threshold values of crack closure, crack initiation and crack damage for
   each testing condition during the whole deformation process of the
   specimens. Finally, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyses were performed
   to evaluate the chemical and mineralogical changes that occur in
   reservoir rocks during CO2 injection. From the test results, it is clear
   that the CO2-saturated samples possessed a lower peak strength compared
   to non-CO2 saturated samples. According to SEM, XRD and XRF analyses,
   considerable quartz mineral corrosion and dissolution of calcite and
   siderite were observed during the interactions of the CO2/water/rock and
   CO2/brine/rock systems, which implies that mineralogical and geochemical
   rock alterations affect rock mechanical properties by accelerating the
   collapse mechanisms of the pore matrix. AE results also reveal the
   weakening effect of rock pore structure with CO2 injection, which
   suggests a significant effect of CO2 on failure mechanisms of the
   reservoir rock, with CO2 saturation showing a significant influence on
   crack initiation and crack damage stages. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Ti/Al3Ti metal-intermetallic laminate (MIL) composite is fabricated
   using Ti and Al foils through the vacuum sintering process. The fracture
   behavior of the MIL laminate composite under dynamic loading is
   investigated via modified Hopkinson bar loaded three-point bending

   simulate the fracture behavior of MIL composite. In this method, the
   brittle damage model and plastic kinematic model are employed to
   represent the dynamic responses of the brittle intermetallic matrix
   Al3Ti and ductile reinforcement of Ti, respectively. As the boundary
   condition, displacement data obtained from dynamic three-point bending
   fracture test are imported into the finite element software package for
   simulation. Finite element model is validated through the comparison of
   the load-displacement curves from numerical simulation and the Hopkinson
   bar loaded three-point bending test. In addition, the dynamic damage
   evolution behaviors of the laminate composite, including crack
   deflection, delamination, plastic deformation, and brittle fracture are
   investigated using the post-process technique of finite element software
   package. The current study demonstrates that the MIL composite has
   excellent damage tolerance due to the multiple energy-absorbing

Title = {{The linear-elastic Theory of Critical Distances to estimate high-cycle

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the accuracy of the linear-elastic Theory of
   Critical Distances (TCD) in estimating high-cycle fatigue strength of
   notched metallic materials experiencing elevated temperatures during
   in-service operations. The TCD postulates that the fatigue damage extent
   can be estimated by directly post-processing the entire linear-elastic
   stress field acting on the material in the vicinity of the crack
   initiation locations. The key feature of this theory is that the
   high-cycle fatigue assessment is based on a scale length parameter that
   is assumed to be a material property. The accuracy of this design method
   was checked against a number of experimental results generated, under
   axial loading, by testing, at 250 degrees C, notched specimens of carbon
   steel C45. To further investigate the reliability of the TCD, its
   accuracy was also checked via several data taken from the literature,
   these experimental results being generated by testing notched samples of
   Inconel 718 at 500 degrees C as well as notched specimens of
   directionally solidified superalloy DZ125 at 850 degrees C. This
   validation exercise allowed us to prove that the linear-elastic TCD is
   successful in estimating high-cycle fatigue strength of notched metallic
   materials exposed to elevated temperature, resulting in estimates
   falling within an error interval of +/- 20\%. Such a high level of
   accuracy suggests that, in situations of practical interest, reliable
   high-cycle fatigue assessment can be performed without the need for
   taking into account those non-linearities characterising the mechanical
   behaviour of metallic materials at high temperature, the used critical
   distance being still a material property whose value does not depend on
   the sharpness of the notch being designed.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature plays an important role in many rock engineering practices.
   The increase or decrease of temperature induces the damage characterized
   by cracks/voids in the rock and thus reduces its strength. Therefore it
   is essential to quantify the damage induced by the heat-treatment and
   establish its correlation to the mechanical properties of rocks. In this
   study, X-ray Micro-computed tomography (CT), a non-destructive
   observation technique was utilized to quantify the damage induced by the
   heat-treatment. Using CT images, the damage variables were measured for
   Longyou sandstone (IS) at three heat-treatment temperatures, 250 degrees
   C, 450 degrees C, and 600 degrees C, and room temperature of 25 degrees
   C. The dynamic compressive strength of LS was then obtained by a
   modified split Hopkinson pressure bar system with the loading rate from
   10(2) to 10(4) GPa/s. An empirical equation to quantify the correlation
   between the damage variable and the dynamic compressive strength was
   established from the experimental data. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},

Volume = {{189}},
Pages = {{58-67}},
Month = {{APR 30}},
Abstract = {{Rocks can be subjected to high temperatures in several instances as for
   example in geothermal processes or if affected by fires. Temperature
   variations lead to a complex stress distribution in crystalline rocks
   due to mineral thermal expansion. In polymineralic such as granites,
   these stresses depend on fabric parameters such as mineral proportion,
   grain size and their related thermal properties.
   Eight granitic rocks were heated to less than 400 degrees C and their
   decay patterns were observed and quantified by means of scanning
   electron microscopy. Heating was also modeled by finite-element
   simulations (OOF software) with polymineralic microstructures. Quartz,
   feldspar and biotite contents were used as a variable in the model in
   order to elucidate the influence of mineralogy on the thermal-elastic
   response of granites.
   Real and modeled heating showed similar trends of microcracking in
   microstructures and of thermal expansion coefficients. Microscopic
   observations of real samples revealed mainly intragranular microcracks
   in quartz, opening of cleavage plains and deformation in mica.
   Simulations confirmed that in spite of the high thermal and anisotropic
   expansion of quartz, the microstructure of rocks with large amounts of
   quartz does not necessarily experience large stresses. Biotite produces
   a concentration of stresses along their grain boundaries. As a result,
   OOF models with 10\% biotite showed higher stresses than monomineral
   ones. Thermal expansion coefficients of real granites fitted within the
   limits of the simulated ones proving once more the success of using
   finite element modeling applied to polymineralic rocks. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Crack propagation in brittle materials with anisotropic surface energy
   is important in applications involving single crystals, extruded
   polymers, or geological and organic materials. Furthermore, when this
   anisotropy is strong, the phenomenology of crack propagation becomes
   very rich, with forbidden crack propagation directions or complex
   sawtooth crack patterns. This problem interrogates fundamental issues in
   fracture mechanics, including the principles behind the selection of
   crack direction. Here, we propose a variational phase-field model for
   strongly anisotropic fracture, which resorts to the extended
   Cahn-Hilliard framework proposed in the context of crystal growth.
   Previous phase-field models for anisotropic fracture were formulated in
   a framework only allowing for weak anisotropy. We implement numerically
   our higher-order phase-field model with smooth local maximum entropy

Abstract = {{In this paper fatigue crack growth in steel plates reinforced by using
   carbon fiber reinforced (CFRP) strips is investigated from the
   experimental, numerical and analytical point of view. Single edge
   notched tension (SENT) specimens were strengthened with different
   reinforcement configurations and tested at a stress ratio R of 0.4.
   Different initial damage levels were considered and the experimental
   results showed that the reinforcement application can effectively reduce
   the crack growth rate and significantly extend the fatigue life.
   Numerical models (finite elements) were also developed to evaluate the
   stress intensity factor (SIF) and the crack opening displacement (COD)
   profile. Based on the numerical results, an analytical model was
   proposed to predict the fatigue crack growth rate and the fatigue crack
   growth curves. The analytical results are validated by comparing the
   fatigue crack growth curves to the experimental ones. (C) 2014 Elsevier

   assisted by shape memory effect}},
Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{25-40}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Solid healing agents, such as thermoplastic particles, have been widely
   used in molecular healing of thermosetting polymers, including
   conventional thermosetting polymers such as epoxy and thermosetting
   shape memory polymers (SMPs) such as polystyrene. Despite extensive
   experimental developments in this field, there is an urgent need for
   healing theories with the ability to correlate molecular level healing
   events to the bulk scale recovered material properties. A multiscale
   healing constitutive theory is developed in this manuscript for
   self-crack-healing composites with embedded solid healing agents. It is
   assumed that the matrix is made of SMP; and the model accounts for
   several microscopic healing processes including; (a) rearrangement of
   free crack surfaces, (b) surface approaching due to shape memory effect,
   (c) wetting the free surfaces by the molten solid healing agent, (d)
   diffusion of the solid healing agent, which has been molten upon
   heating, into the crack surfaces, and (e) randomization. The Continuum
   Damage Healing Mechanics (CDHM) is utilized to bridge the microscopic
   and bulk scales. The healing parameters correlate the microscopic level
   descriptions of the healing to the recovery of bulk material properties.
   The model is then introduced into the ABAQUS, through user-defined
   coding, and it is shown that it correlates well with the experimental
   observations. The developed physically consistent multiscale theory
   provides material designers with the ability to optimize their
   self-healing systems via computer aided simulations. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Concretes with micro-encapsulated healing agents are very appealing due
   to the advantages of self-healing and the potential for controllable
   quantifiable healing on a large scale with little initial damage. Based
   on experimental observation and Taylor's model, a two-dimensional
   micromechanical damage-healing model of microcapsule-enabled
   self-healing cementitious materials under tensile loading has been
   proposed. The healing effect on microcrack-induced damage can now be
   predicted quantitatively by its microscopic healing mechanism. The
   kinetic equations of damage-healing evolution and the formulations of
   compliance after healing are developed. Subsequently, simple and
   efficient numerical simulations are presented and different system
   parameters of microcapsule-enabled self-healing concretes, such as the
   radius and volume fraction of microcapsules, fracture toughness of
   healing agents and initial damage degree, are investigated. In
   particular, the proposed micromechanical damage-healing model
   demonstrates the potential capability to explain and simulate the
   physical behavior of microcapsule-enabled self-healing materials on the

Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental investigation of the damage
   mechanisms of granites under uniaxial tension. The displacement
   distribution and surface tensile strain of the specimens were measured
   by using a digital image correlation (DIC) method. A substantially large
   strain localization region emerged on the surface of the specimens
   before the tensile stress approached its ultimate value; subsequently,
   this strain localization region coincided with the final crack. Based on
   the measured tensile strain, a parameter was proposed to describe the
   average gradient of the tensile strain. This parameter was found to be
   much larger near the crack than in the other regions. Experimental
   results showed that the damage was related to the strain as well as to
   the strain gradient. These results may provide a practical foundation
   for a new gradient damage theory for rocks under tensile loading. (C)

Abstract = {{The influence of defects on the fatigue strength of a cast Ti-6Al-4V

   Then, reference fatigue properties have been determined and reduction of
   the fatigue strength has been quantified for artificial and natural
   defects. It is shown that an artificial defect with a chemically milled
   surface is representative of an in-service component surface machining:
   surface pinholes have similar influence on the fatigue behaviour.
   Furthermore, the experimental results have shown that the geometrical
   morphology is not the major parameter that governs the fatigue life
   reduction: the defect type has a major influence. It is also shown that
   the initiation stage is not negligible in the total fatigue life about
   10(5)cycles. Kitagawa diagrams were built to determine critical defect

Journal = {{WEAR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{328}},
Pages = {{443-455}},

Abstract = {{The fretting process can lead to material removal (wear), nucleation and
   propagation of cracks (fatigue), or both. In the first step, the aim of
   the present paper is to investigate the influence of non-linear
   behaviour on the wear profiles, in order to evaluate the role of
   plasticity under different slip regimes for a cylinder-on-flat contact
   fretting wear. The material of the study is a classical titanium alloy,
   Ti-6Al-4V (noted TA6V in the following) that is represented by a von
   Mises equivalent stress, and a combination of non-linear kinematic
   hardening and isotropic hardening. Since wear is not the only damage
   mechanism, crack propagation is also considered in the second step. The
   competition between wear and crack initiation is investigated, thanks to
   two types of fatigue criteria, purely stress dependent models (Dang Van
   and Crossland), and a stress strain dependent fatigue model (Smith
   Watson Topper). The contact evolution influences fretting crack
   nucleation. The objective is to determine the relevant fatigue criterion
   and compare the numerical results to the experimental fretting map. (C)
