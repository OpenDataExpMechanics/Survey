Abstract = {{Disorder and long-range interactions are two of the key components that
   make material failure an interesting playfield for the application of
   statistical mechanics. The cornerstone in this respect has been lattice
   models of the fracture in which a network of elastic beams, bonds, or
   electrical fuses with random failure thresholds are subject to an
   increasing external load. These models describe on a qualitative level
   the failure processes of real, brittle, or quasi-brittle materials. This
   has been particularly important in solving the classical engineering
   problems of material strength: the size dependence of maximum stress and
   its sample-to-sample statistical fluctuations. At the same time, lattice
   models pose many new fundamental questions in statistical physics, such
   as the relation between fracture and phase transitions. Experimental
   results point out to the existence of an intriguing crackling noise in
   the acoustic emission and of self-affine fractals in the crack surface
   morphology. Recent advances in computer power have enabled considerable
   progress in the understanding of such models. Among these partly still
   controversial issues, are the scaling and size-effects in material
   strength and accumulated damage, the statistics of avalanches or bursts
   of microfailures, and the morphology of the crack surface. Here we
   present an overview of the results obtained with lattice models for
   fracture, highlighting the relations with statistical physics theories
   and more conventional fracture mechanics approaches.}},

Abstract = {{A thermodynamically consistent damage model is proposed for the
   simulation of progressive delamination in composite materials under

   criterion is proposed to assure that the formulation can account for
   changes in the loading mode in a thermodynamically consistent way. The
   formulation accounts for crack closure effects to avoid interfacial
   penetration of two adjacent layers after complete decohesion. The model
   is implemented in a finite element formulation, and the numerical
   predictions are compared with experimental results obtained in both
   composite test specimens and structural components. (C) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The life of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) is currently
   limited by the mechanical endurance of polymer electrolyte membranes and
   membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs). In this paper, the authors report
   recent experimental and modeling work toward understanding the
   mechanisms of delayed mechanical failures of polymer electrolyte
   membranes and MEAs under relevant PEMFC operating conditions. Mechanical
   breach of membranes/MEAs in the form of pinholes and tears has been
   frequently observed after long-term or accelerated testing of PEMFC
   cells/stacks. Catastrophic failure of cell/stack due to rapid gas
   crossover shortly follows the mechanical breach. Ex situ mechanical
   characterizations were performed on MEAs after being subjected to the
   accelerated chemical aging and relative humidity (RH) cycling tests. The
   results showed significant reduction of MEA ductility manifested as
   drastically reduced strain-to-failure of the chemically aged and
   RH-cycled MEAs. Postmortem analysis revealed the formation and growth of
   mechanical defects such as cracks and crazing in the membranes and MEAs.
   A finite element model was used to estimate stress/strain states of an
   edge-constrained MEA under rapid RH variations. Damage metrics for
   accelerated testing and life prediction of PEMFCs are discussed. (c)

Abstract = {{This paper presents a feasibility study for practical applications of an

   (Lead-Zirconate-Titanate) patches to concrete structures. First,
   comparison between experimental and analytical studies for damage

   progressive surface damage inflicted artificially on the plain concrete
   beam is assessed by using both lateral and thickness modes of the PZT
   patches. Then, an analytical study based on finite element (FE) models
   is carried out to verify the validity of the experimental result.
   Secondly, multiple (shear and flexural) cracks incurred in a reinforced
   concrete (RC) beam under a third point bending test are monitored
   continuously by using a sensor array system composed of the PZT patches.
   In this study, a root mean square deviation (RMSD) in the impedance
   signatures of the PZT patches is used as a damage indicator.}},

Abstract = {{The fracture strength of Si is considered in the context of yield and
   reliability of microelectronic and microelectromechanical (MEMS)
   devices. An overview of Si fracture, including the strength of Si
   wafers, dice and MEMS elements, highlights the importance of
   understanding sharp contact flaws, with their attendant residual stress
   fields, lateral cracks and strength-limiting half-penny cracks in
   advanced Si device manufacturing, Techniques using controlled
   indentation flaws, including measurements of hardness, crack lengths,
   crack propagation under applied stress, and inert and reactive
   strengths, are applied in an extensive new experimental study of
   intrinsic, n- and p-type \{100\} and \{110\} Si single crystals and
   polycrystalline Si, addressing many of the issues discussed in the
   overview. The new results are directly applicable in interpreting the
   strengths of ground or diced Si wafer surfaces and provide a foundation
   for studying the strengths of MEMS elements, for which the
   strength-controlling flaws are less well-defined. Although the
   indentation fracture behavior of Si is shown to be quite anisotropic,
   the extensive lateral cracking greatly affects crack lengths and
   strengths, obscuring the underlying single crystal fracture anisotropy.
   No effects of doping on fracture are observed. Strength decreases in
   water and air suggest that Si is susceptible to reactive attack by
   moisture, although the effect is mild and extremely rapid. Strength
   increases of indented components after buffered HF etching are shown to
   be due to reactive attack of the contact impression, leading to residual
   stress relief. (c) 2006 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Systematic investigations of fatigue damage and dislocation structures
   in thin Cu films with different thicknesses (0.2-3.0 mu m) and grain
   sizes (0.3-2.1 mu m mean diameter) were carried out using focused ion
   beam microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The morphologies
   of fatigue-induced extrusions, cracks, and dislocation structures were
   studied and found to be controlled by film thickness and grain size.
   When either of these length scales is decreased below roughly 1 mu m,
   the typical dislocation wall and cell structures found in fatigued
   coarse-grained bulk materials no longer develop and are replaced by
   individual dislocations. Similarly, the typical surface damage of
   fatigued bulk metals, such as extrusions and cracks near extrusions, is
   gradually suppressed and replaced by damage that is localized at
   interfaces, such as cracks, grooves, and voids along grain and twin
   boundaries. This gradual transition from damage characteristic of bulk
   metals to damage localized at interfaces is attributed to constraints on
   dislocation activity at submicrometer length scales. Based on the
   experimental results and a theoretical analysis of extrusion formation,
   a mechanistic map of fatigue damage behavior is proposed that summarizes
   this length scale dependence. (c) 2006 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{Resistance to high velocity impact is an important requirement for high
   performance structural materials. Even though, polymer matrix composites
   are characterized by high specific stiffness and high specific strength,
   they are susceptible to impact loading. For the effective use of such
   materials in structural applications, their behaviour under high
   velocity impact should be clearly understood. In the present study,
   investigations on the ballistic impact behaviour of two-dimensional
   woven fabric composites have been presented. Ballistic impact is
   generally a low-mass high velocity impact caused by a propelling source.
   The analytical method presented is based on wave theory. Different
   damage and energy absorbing mechanisms during ballistic impact have been
   identified. These are: cone formation on the back face of the target,
   tension in primary yarns, deformation of secondary yarns, delamination,
   matrix cracking, shear plugging and friction during penetration.
   Analytical formulation has been presented for each energy absorbing
   mechanism. Energy absorbed during each time interval and the
   corresponding reduction in velocity of the projectile has been
   determined. The solution is based on the target material properties at
   high strain rate and the geometry and the projectile parameters. Using
   the analytical formulation, ballistic limit, contact duration at
   ballistic limit, surface radius of the cone formed and the radius of the
   damaged zone have been predicted for typical woven fabric composites.
   The analytical predictions have been compared with the experimental
   results. A good correlation has been observed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of experimental studies on piezoelectric
   lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT)-based active damage detection techniques
   for nondestructive evaluations (NDE) of steel bridge components. PZT
   patches offer special features suitable for real-time in situ health
   monitoring systems for large and complex steel structures, because they
   are small, light, cheap, and useful as built-in sensor systems. Both
   impedance and Lamb wave methods are considered for damage detection of
   lab-size steel bridge members. Several damage-sensitive features are
   extracted: root mean square deviations (RMSD) in the impedances and
   wavelet coefficients (WC) of Lamb waves, and the times of flight (TOF)
   of Lamb waves. Advanced signal processing and pattern recognition
   techniques such as continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and support vector
   machine (SVM) are used in the current system. Firstly, PZT patches were
   used in conjunction with the impedance and Lamb waves to detect the
   presence and growth of artificial cracks on a 1/8 scale model for a
   vertical truss member of Seongsu Bridge, Seoul, Korea, which collapsed
   in 1994. The RMSD in the impedances and WC of Lamb waves were found to
   be good damage indicators. Secondly, two PZT patches were used to detect
   damage on a bolt-jointed steel plate, which was simulated by removing
   bolts. The correlation of the Lamb wave transmission data with the
   damage classified by in and out of the wave path was investigated by
   using the TOF and WC obtained from the Lamb wave signals. The SVM was
   implemented to enhance the damage identification capability of the
   current system. The results from the experiments showed the validity of
   the proposed methods.}},

Abstract = {{A new method to combine interface damage and friction in a cohesive-zone
   model is proposed. Starting from the mesomechanical assumption,
   typically made in a damage-mechanics approach, whereby a representative
   elementary area of the interface can be additively decomposed into an
   undamaged and a fully damaged part, the main idea consists of assuming
   that friction occurs only on the fully damaged part. The gradual
   increase of the friction effect is then a natural outcome of the gradual
   increase of the interface damage from the initial undamaged state to the
   complete decohesion. Suitable kinematic and static hypotheses are made
   in order to develop the interface model whereas no special assumptions
   are required on the damage evolution equations and on the friction law.
   Here, the Crisfield's interface model is used for the damage evolution
   and a simple Coulomb friction relationship is adopted. Numerical and
   analytical results for two types of constitutive problem show the
   effectiveness of the model to capture all the main features of the
   combined effect of interface damage and friction. A finite-step
   interface law has then been derived and implemented in a finite-element
   code via interface elements. The results of the simulations made for a
   fibre push-out test and a masonry wall loaded in compression and shear
   are then presented and compared with available experimental results.
   They show the effectiveness of the proposed model to predict the failure
   mechanisms and the overall structural response for the analysed
   problems. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{Synchrotron radiation micro-computed tomography (SR mu CT) is a very
   useful technique when it comes to three-dimensional (3D) imaging of
   complex internal and external geometries. Being a fully non-destructive
   technique, SR mu CT can be combined with other experiments in situ for
   functional imaging. We are especially interested in the combination of
   SR mu CT with mechanical testing in order to gain new insights in the
   failure mechanism of trabecular bone. This interest is motivated by the
   immense costs in health care due to patients suffering from
   osteoporosis, a systemic skeletal disease resulting in decreased bone
   stability and increased fracture risk. To better investigate the
   different failure mechanisms on the microlevel, we have developed a
   novel in situ mechanical compression device, capable of exerting both
   static and dynamic displacements on experimental samples. The device was
   calibrated for mechanical testing using solid aluminum and bovine
   trabecular bone samples. To study different failure mechanisms in
   trabecular bone, we compared a fatigued and a non-fatigued bovine bone
   sample with respect to failure initiation and propagation. The fatigued
   sample failed in a burst-like fashion in contrast to the non-fatigued
   sample, which exhibited a distinct localized failure band. Moreover,
   microscopic cracks - microcracks and microfractures - were uncovered in
   a 3D fashion illustrating the failure process in great detail. The
   majority of these cracks were connected to a bone surface. The data also
   showed that the classification of microcracks and -fractures from 2D
   section can sometimes be ambiguous, which is also true for the
   distinction of diffuse and distinct microdamage. Detailed investigation
   of the failure mechanism in these samples illustrated that trabecular
   bone often fails in delamination, providing a mechanism for energy
   dissipation while conserving trabecular bone architecture. In the
   future, this will allow an even better understanding of bone mechanics
   related to its hierarchical structural organization. (c) 2006 Elsevier

   order to eliminate the diverse interference, a wavelet transform
   technique was applied to purify the acquired Lamb wave signals, and the

   spectrum. A correlation function was further established, which helped
   identify the crack position based on a triangulation approach with the
   aid of a nonlinear least-squares optimization algorithm. Such an
   approach provides satisfactory results in locating the crack position in
   aluminium plates with cracks of 5 and 20 mm in length.}},

Abstract = {{A cohesive zone model (CZM) has been used in conjunction with both
   elastic and elastoplastic continuum behaviour to predict the response of
   a mixed mode flexure and three different lap shear joints, all
   manufactured with the same adhesive. It was found that, for a specific
   dissipated CZM energy (Gamma(0)) there was a range of CZM tripping
   tractions (sigma(u)) that gave a fairly constant failure load. A value
   of sigma(u) below this range gave rise to global damage throughout the
   bonded region before any crack propagation initiated. A value above this
   range gave rise to a discontinuous process zone, which resulted in
   failure loads that were strongly dependent on sigma(u). A discontinuous
   process zone gives rise to mesh dependent results. The CZM parameters
   used in the predictions were determined from the experimental fracture
   mechanics specimen test data. When damage initiated, a deviation from
   the linear load-displacement curve was observed. The value for sigma(u)
   was determined by identifying the magnitude that gave rise to the
   experimentally observed deviation. The CZM energy (Gamma(0)) was then
   obtained by correlating the simulated load-crack length response with
   corresponding experimental data. The R-curve behaviour seen with
   increasing crack length was successfully simulated when adhesive
   plasticity was included in the constitutive model of the adhesive layer.
   This was also seen to enhance the prediction of the lap shear specimens.
   Excellent correlation was found between the experimental and predicted
   joint strengths.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method for the identification of deformation,
   damage and fracture properties of ductile materials. The small punch
   test is used to obtain the material response under loading. The
   resulting load displacement curve contains information about the
   deformation and failure behavior of the tested material. The finite
   element method is used to compute the load displacement curve depending
   on the parameters of the Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman damage law. Via a
   systematic variation of the material parameters a data base is built up,
   which is used to train neural networks. This neural network can be used
   to predict the load displacement curve of the SPT for a given material
   parameter set. The identification of the material parameters is done by
   using a conjugate directions algorithm, which minimizes the error
   between an experimental load displacement curve and one predicted by the
   network function. The identified material parameters are validated by
   independent tests on notched tensile specimens. Furthermore, these
   parameters can be used to compute the crack growth in fracture
   specimens, which finally leads to a prediction of classical fracture
   toughness parameters. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{As a result of underlying pathological diseases, such as osteoporosis,
   osteopenia, or due to altered loading after joint replacements, bones
   become more susceptible to microdamage accumulation than those of normal
   human beings, as are those of athletes who undertake strenuous exercise
   {[}Stromsoe, 2004. Fracture fixation problems in osteoporosis. Injury
   35, 107-113]. Experimental evidence has linked bone adaptation to
   microdamage, and to increased cell activity. In this work, we
   investigated whether microcrack detection is related to rupturing of the
   cellular material itself due to crack face displacements. Using specific
   cell staining techniques, it was confirmed that relative crack
   displacements are capable of tearing cell processes between neighbouring
   osteocytes. No ruptured cell processes were found near the crack tip
   where the displacements are less. Rupturing of cell processes due to
   crack opening and shear displacement is a feasible new mechanism by
   which bone can detect and estimate the size of a microcrack. Ruptured
   cell processes may directly secrete passive and active components in the
   extracellular matrix, triggering a repair response. (c) 2005 Published

Abstract = {{Tensile failure of unreinforced concrete involves progressive
   micro-cracking, and the related strain-softening can coalesce into
   geometrical discontinuities, which separate the material. Advanced
   mechanical theories and numerical schemes are required to efficiently
   and adequately represent crack propagation in 3D. In this paper we use
   the concept of strong discontinuities to model concrete failure. We
   introduce a cohesive fracture process zone, which is characterized by a
   transversely isotropic traction-separation law. We combine the cohesive
   crack concept with the partition of unity finite element method, where
   the finite element space is enhanced by the Heaviside function. The
   concept is implemented for tetrahedral elements and the failure
   initialization is based on the simple (non-local) Rankine criterion. For
   each element we assume the embedded discontinuity to be flat in the
   reference configuration, which leads to a non-smooth crack surfaces
   approximation in 3D, in general; different concepts for tracking
   non-planar cracks in 3D are reviewed. In addition, we propose a two-step
   algorithm for tracking the crack path, where a predictor step defines
   discontinuities according to the (non-local) failure criterion and a
   corrector step draws in non-local information of the existing
   discontinuities in order to predict a `closed' 3D crack surface;
   implementation details are provided. The proposed framework is used to
   analyze the predictability of concrete failure by two benchmark
   examples, i.e. the Nooru-Moharned test, and the Brokenshire test. We
   compare our numerical results, which are mesh independent, with
   experimental data and numerical results adopted from the literature. (c)

Abstract = {{This paper presents a 26 degree of freedom gear dynamic model of three
   shafts and two pairs of spur gears in mesh for comparison of localised
   tooth spalling and damage. This paper details how tooth spalling and
   cracks can be included in the model by using the combined torsional mesh
   stiffness of the gears. The FEA models developed for calculation of the
   torsional stiffness and tooth load sharing ratio of the gears in mesh
   with the spalling and crack damage are also described. The dynamic
   simulation results of vibration from the gearbox were obtained by using
   Matlab and Simulink models, which were developed from the equations of
   motion. The simulation results were found to be consistent with results
   from previously published mathematical analysis and experimental
   investigations. The difference and comparison between the vibration
   signals with the tooth crack and spalling damage are discussed by
   investigating some of the common diagnostic functions and changes to the
   frequency spectra results. The result of this paper indicates that the
   amplitude and phase modulation of the coherent time synchronous
   vibration signal average can be effective in indicating the difference
   between localised tooth spalling and crack damage. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper presents an analytical and numerical study of time dependent
   crack growth at elevated temperatures. A triaxiality dependent damage
   model is used to represent the multiaxial creep ductility of the
   material and an analytical model to predict steady state crack growth in
   terms of the fracture parameter C, designated the NSW-MOD model, is
   presented. This model is an enhancement of the earlier NSW model for
   creep crack growth as it accounts for the dependence of stress and
   strain on angular position around the crack tip. Elastic-creep and
   elastic-plastic-creep finite element analyses are performed for a
   cracked compact tension specimen and the crack propagation rate in the
   specimen is predicted. It is found that in general the NSW-MOD model
   gives an accurate estimate of the crack growth rate when compared to the
   finite element predictions and experimental data for a carbon-manganese
   steel. However, crack growth rates predicted from the finite element
   analysis at low values of C{*} may be higher than those predicted by
   either the NSW or NSW-MOD model. This enhanced level of crack growth may
   be associated with the non-steady state conditions experienced at the

Abstract = {{The paper presents the results of an experimental investigation on the

   bonded with epoxy adhesive were tested under tension-tension fatigue

   discussed by using the classical stress-life approach. Significant
   improvements in fatigue strength can be obtained by adopting long
   overlap length and spew fillet corner geometry. A careful analysis of
   the evolution of the fatigue damage was also carried out and it was
   observed that a significant fraction of the fatigue life of the joint is
   spent in the nucleation of one or more cracks which then propagate up to
   failure of the joint. The duration of nucleation process, which can last
   from 20\% up to 70\% of the joint life, suggests the need of
   incorporating this phase in the development of future predictive models.

Abstract = {{A new constitutive model is proposed for the description of induced
   anisotropic damage in brittle rocks. The formulation of the model is
   based on relevant results from micromechanics consideration. The
   distribution of microcracks is approximated by a second-order damage
   tensor. The effective elastic properties of damaged material are derived
   from the free enthalpy function. The evolution of damage is directly
   related to the growth of microcracks in different space orientations.
   The volumetric dilatancy due to sliding crack opening is taken into
   account. The model is extended to the description of creep deformation
   in brittle rocks. The time dependent deformation is seen as a
   consequence of the sub-critical propagation of microcracks due to stress
   corrosion process. The proposed model is applied to a typical brittle
   rock, the Lac du Bonnet granite. A general good agreement is obtained

Abstract = {{In this study, two types of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) confined

   cylinders; the other was FRP tube encased concrete cylinders. A total of

   jacketed cylinders, six fiber orientations and two FRP wall thicknesses
   were used; for the encased cylinders, four batches of concrete with
   normal to high strength were used and both bonded and unbonded
   interfacial conditions were considered. It is found that insufficiently
   confined cylinders behave similar to unconfined cylinders. FRP cannot
   confine the concrete core until the concrete is damaged (cracked or
   crushed) due to the larger transverse Poisson's ratio and lower axial
   stiffness of FRP. The rate of increase in confinement effectiveness
   decreases nonlinearly as confinement ratio increases. A considerable

Abstract = {{The purpose of this work is to simulate the evolution of ductile damage

   A low alloy steel for pressure vessels (20MnMoNi55) was chosen as
   reference material. The work includes both experimental and simulation
   phases. The experimental campaign involves different kinds of specimens
   and testing conditions. First, monotonic tensile tests have been
   performed in order to evaluate tensile and ductile damage behaviour.
   Then, the cyclic yielding behaviour has been characterized performing
   cyclic plasticity tests on cylindrical bars. Finally, cyclic loading
   tests in the plastic regime have been made on different round notched
   bars (RNBs) to study the evolution of plastic deformation and damage
   under multiaxial stress conditions. The predictions of the different
   models were compared in terms of both, the specimens macroscopic
   response and local damage. Special emphasis was laid on predictions of
   the number of cycles prior to final failure and the crack initiation

Abstract = {{This paper presents an approach to detect surface cracks in various

   fabricate laminated plates, {[}0](16), {[}90](16), {[}(0/90)(4)]s and
   {[}+/- 45/0/90](2S). Surface crack damage was created on one side of the
   plate using a laser cutting machine. Modal analysis was performed to
   obtain the mode shapes from both experimental and finite element
   analysis results. The mode shapes were then used to calculate strain
   energy using the differential quadrature method (DQM). Consequently, the
   strain energies of laminated plates before and after damaged were used
   to define a damage index which successfully identified the surface crack

Abstract = {{In the first part of this work {[}Quaresimin M, Ricotta M. Fatigue
   behaviour and damage evolution of single lap bonded joints in composite
   material.. Compos Sci Technol, in press] the fatigue behaviour of single
   lap bonded joints in composite materials was investigated. In this
   paper, the results of an extensive investigation on the stress intensity
   factors (SIFs) and strain energy release rate (SERR) for the same joints
   are presented and discussed. Linear elastic finite element analyses were
   carried out to evaluate generalised SIFs in the geometry of interest and
   the influence of overlap length, corner geometry, adhesive properties
   and thickness was investigated. Geometric nonlinear analyses were
   instead used for the analysis of the SERR trends as a function of the
   crack length. On the basis of these results, a new equivalent
   formulation for the SERR was introduced, suitable to account for the
   mixed-mode loading condition as well as for the continuous variation of
   the mode-mixity during the fatigue life of the joints. The results
   presented here, together with the experimental results reported in the
   first part of the work, represent the basis for development and
   validation of a life prediction methodology, which is discussed in the

Abstract = {{Extensive research and studies on concrete fracture and failure have
   shown that concrete should be viewed as a quasi-brittle material having
   a size-dependent behaviour. Numerous experimental techniques have been
   employed to evaluate fracture processes, and a number of modelling
   approaches have been developed to predict fracture behaviour. The
   non-destructive method based on the Acoustic Emission (AE) technique has
   proved highly effective, especially to check and measure the damage
   phenomena that take place inside a structure subjected to mechanical
   loading. In this paper an experimental investigation conducted on
   concrete and RC structures by means of the AE technique is described.
   The AE signals reflecting the release of energy taking place during the
   damage process were recorded and micro-cracking sources were localised
   by measuring time delays by means of spatially distributed AE sensors.}},

   understanding of damage accumulation in two-dimensional (2D) and
   three-dimensional (3D) woven glass-fiber-reinforced composite panels

   Measurements were obtained for impact force and energy dissipation. The
   radial spread of damage was smallest for the 2D laminates and largest
   for the 3D woven composites. The 3D composites had the greatest
   resistance to penetration and dissipated more total energy than the
   laminate system. This damage tolerance is due to unique energy
   absorption mechanisms, which involve the crimped portion of z-tows in
   the 3D composites. This is significant, since 3D architectures can
   provide both an inherent capability to dissipate energy over a large
   radial area and a greater perforation strength than comparable 2D

Volume = {{22}},

Pages = {{2272-2300}},
Abstract = {{The paper concerns the description and the validation of a constitutive
   model for concrete characterized by a combined
   plastic-hardening-damage-fracture dissipative criterion developed within
   the framework of the simple material model, so that its numerical
   implementation is easy and robust. Two different damage isotropic
   mechanisms associated with tensile and compressive strain processes are
   introduced and two hardening variables are used; the first rules the
   plastic hardening while the second controls the compaction of the
   material. The limit domain is defined through the envelope of three
   yield criteria presenting a strong and original coupling between plastic
   and damage dissipative mechanisms. It is demonstrated that the proposed
   framework allows the reproduction of some distinctive features of the
   behavior of concrete under multiaxial stress states, such as volumetric
   hardening in triaxial compression load processes, the increment of
   strength under confined compression, post-peak dilatancy, varying
   degradation of the elastic stiffness in tensile or compressive stress
   states, the increase of the limit strain in cyclic processes. A
   comparison of the numerical predictions with the literature experimental
   tests is presented. The limits of the proposed model are also discussed

Abstract = {{The paper presents a model for the prediction of the fatigue life of
   composite bonded joints. The model was developed on the basis of
   extensive experimental and numerical investigations, presented in the

   of single lap bonded joints in composite material. Compos Sci Technol,
   2006;66:176-87] and second {[}Quaresimin M, Ricotta M. Stress intensity
   factors and strain energy release rates in single lap bonded joints in
   composite materials. Compos Sci Technol, 2006;66:647-56] part of this
   work.
   The model is based on the actual mechanics of the fatigue damage
   evolution and describes the joint lifetime as the sequence of a crack
   nucleation phase followed by a propagation phase. The nucleation phase
   was modelled by using a generalised stress intensity factor (SIF)
   approach, summarising the fatigue data to crack initiation in scatter
   bands in terms of generalised SIFs. The life spent in the propagation
   phase was obtained by integration of a Paris-like power law relating the
   strain energy release rate (SERR) to the rate of the crack growth. The
   Paris curves were obtained by combination of crack propagation data
   measured on the joints and functions describing the SERR variations with
   the crack length calculated via FE analysis. Several alternative
   combinations of crack propagation data and SERR components were compared
   to investigate their possible influence on the life prediction. The
   model validation provided a good agreement between predictions and
   experimental fatigue data obtained for single lap joints with different
   overlap length and corner geometry. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   found that the actuator-sensor paths that are most sensitive to crack
   growth are the ones in which the crack is growing away from, rather than
   towards the path. This discovery will provide important guidelines for
   the design of a sensor network for crack detection. It was also observed

   elasticity and strength parameters, (2) the geometric features of the
   tool such as the wedge angle, and (3) the lateral confinement simulating
   the far-field stress. A good agreement with regard to indentation
   pressure and damage-zone radius was found between the experimental and

Abstract = {{This paper describes the determination of the location of damage due to
   single cracks and due to honeycombs in RC beams using mode shape
   derivatives from modal testing. The cracks were induced by application
   of point loads at predetermined locations on the RC beams. The load was
   increased in stages to obtain different crack heights to simulate the
   extent and severity of damage. Experimental modal analysis was performed
   on the beams with cracks prior to and after each load cycle, on a
   control beam, and beams with honeycombs. The mode shapes and the
   eigenvectors were used to determine the location of damage.
   The indicator vertical bar lambda(4)vertical bar was obtained by
   rearranging the equation for free transverse vibration of a uniform
   beam, and applying the fourth order centered finite-divided difference
   formula to the regressed mode shape data. The equation is an eigenvalue
   problem, and the value of vertical bar lambda(4)vertical bar will be a
   constant. Differences in the values indicate stiffness change, and the
   affected region indicates the general area of damage.
   Analysis of results using vertical bar lambda(4)vertical bar was able to
   indicate the general region of damage, the exact location being around
   the center of the region. Curve fitting with Chebyshev series rationals
   onto the mode shape also highlighted points of high residuals around the
   region of damage. The proposed algorithm on the mode shape can form the
   basis of a technique for structural health monitoring of damaged
   reinforced concrete structures. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Matrix cracking and delamination are the most common damage mechanisms
   in laminated fiber reinforced composites due to low velocity impact. An
   approach to predict the initiation and propagation of damage in
   composite laminated plates is brought forward in this paper, which is
   based on contact constraint introduced by penalty function method. The
   potential delamination and matrix cracking areas are considered as
   cohesive zone and the damage process as contact behavior between the
   interfaces. A scalar damage variable is introduced and the degradation
   of the interface stiffness is established. A damage surface which
   combines stress-based and fracture-mechanics-based failure criteria is
   set up to derive the damage evolution law. The damage model is
   implemented into a commercial finite element package, ABAQUS, via its
   user subroutine VUINTER. Numerical results on (0(4), 90(4))s
   carbon-epoxy laminate plates due to transversely low velocity impact are

Abstract = {{Crack damage results in a decrease of elastic wave velocities and in the
   development of anisotropy. Using non-interactive crack effective medium
   theory as a fundamental tool, we calculate dry and wet elastic
   properties of cracked rocks in terms of a crack density tensor, average
   crack aspect ratio and mean crack fabric orientation from the solid
   grains and fluid elastic properties. Using this same tool, we show that
   both the anisotropy and shear-wave splitting of elastic waves can be
   derived. Two simple crack distributions are considered for which the
   predicted anisotropy depends strongly on the saturation, reaching up to
   60\% in the dry case. Comparison with experimental data on two granites,
   a basalt and a marble, shows that the range of validity of the
   non-interactive effective medium theory model extends to a total crack
   density of approximately 0.5, considering symmetries up to orthorhombic.
   In the isotropic case, Kachanov's (1994) non-interactive effective
   medium model was used in order to invert elastic wave velocities and
   infer both crack density and aspect ratio evolutions. Inversions are
   stable and give coherent results in terms of crack density and aperture
   evolution. Crack density variations can be interpreted in terms of crack
   growth and/or changes of the crack surface contact areas as cracks are
   being closed or opened respectively. More importantly, the recovered
   evolution of aspect ratio shows an exponentially decreasing aspect ratio
   (and therefore aperture) with pressure, which has broader geophysical
   implications, in particular on fluid flow. The recovered evolution of
   aspect ratio is also consistent with current mechanical theories of
   crack closure. In the anisotropic cases-both transverse isotropic and
   orthorhombic symmetries were considered-anisotropy and saturation
   patterns were well reproduced by the modelling, and mean crack fabric
   orientations we recovered are consistent with in situ geophysical
   imaging.
   Our results point out that: (1) It is possible to predict damage,
   anisotropy and saturation in terms of a crack density tensor and mean
   crack aspect ratio and orientation; (2) using well constrained wave
   velocity data, it is possible to extrapolate the contemporaneous
   evolution of crack density, anisotropy and saturation using wave
   velocity inversion as a tool; 3) using such an inversion tool opens the
   door in linking elastic properties, variations to permeability.}},

   Significant global behavior such as global rocking of an entire wall,
   and local responses such as rocking and sliding of each individual pier
   were observed in the masonry walls with different configurations. In
   addition, formation of flanges in perpendicular walls and overturning
   moments had significant effects on the behavior of the test structure. A

Abstract = {{Ceramic systems have limited long-term fracture resistance, especially

   mechanics methods were used to estimate the stresses at failure in 6
   bridges (50\%) whose fracture initiated from the occlusal surface of the
   connectors. Fracture of 1 non-veneered bridge (8\%) initiated within the
   gingival surface of the connector. Three veneered bridges fractured
   within the veneer layers. Failure stresses of the all-core fixed partial
   dentures ranged from 107 to 161 NPa. Failure stresses of the veneered
   fixed partial dentures ranged from 19 to 68 MPa. We conclude that

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to characterize and compare damage processes in
   carbon/epoxy laminates submitted to either isothermal ageing or thermal
   cycling in neutral (vacuum or nitrogen) and oxidative (air) atmospheres.
   During a thermal cycling test performed in an oxidative atmosphere like
   air, there is a coupling effect between matrix oxidation, occurring at
   the highest temperatures of the cycle, and matrix cracking due to
   thermo-mechanical ply stresses induced by the prevented differential
   expansions of the plies. In order to separate those two damage
   mechanisms, a model of oxidation is used to determine the experimental
   conditions of an isothermal test `equivalent' to a thermal cycling one,
   in terms of mass loss due to oxidation. After having checked this
   equivalence, a quantitative analysis of the damages induced by the two
   types of tests, is carried out. It is shown that the oxidation of a
   laminate in isothermal conditions results in damages, which concern only
   the skin of the sample. On the contrary, the coupling of such damage
   mechanisms with cyclic stresses in thermal cycling accelerates the
   damage processes and especially the matrix crack propagation from the
   surfaces to the core of the laminate. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, a number of experimental round-robin data sets obtained
   using the mode I double cantilever beam (DCB) specimen to evaluate G(IC)
   for fibre composite laminates have been reanalysed with a view to
   determining additional parameters to describe microcracking and damage
   in the composite arm, and the bridging stresses at the crack tip. The
   additional parameters are derived using the length correction term
   deduced from corrected beam theory. However, the reanalysis of the
   round-robin data revealed significant variations in this length
   correction term. It is argued here that these variations originate from
   errors in the measurement of crack length which can be either random or
   systematic. An alternative analysis scheme is proposed from which the
   crack lengths are calculated using the measured compliance and a
   pre-determined flexural modulus value. Such an approach yields
   considerable insight into the accuracy of the test method. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{In composites basically Fibre Failure (FF) and Inter Fibre Failure (IFF)
   of the individual layers of a laminate have to be distinguished. Whereas
   FF inevitably leads to total failure of the laminate certain IFF-modes
   are tolerable for many applications like for example pressure vessels.
   In these pressure vessels the damage process is gradual. When IFF has
   occurred in a layer the stiffness of this layer is lowered and part of
   its load transferred to other layers of the laminate leading there to
   higher stresses and potentially to further failure. This so called
   gradual failure process has so far not been considered in stress and
   strength analysis of FRP-components based on the Classical Laminate
   Theory (CLT). In order to change this unsatisfying situation
   comprehensive experimental data for the calibration of degradation
   models - which quantify the loss of stiffness - has been generated for
   the first time. With this data and the newly developed analytical
   program Subu the gradual failure process in Fibre/polymer-laminates can
   now be calculated more realistically. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the numerical simulation of quasi-static ductile
   fracture. The main focus is on numerical and stability aspects related
   to discrete crack propagation. Crack initiation and propagation are
   taken into account, both driven by the evolution of a discretely coupled
   damage variable. Discrete ductile failure is embedded in a geometrically
   nonlinear hyperelasto-plastic model, triggered by an appropriate
   criterion that has been evaluated for tensile and shear failure. A crack
   direction criterion is proposed, which is validated for both failure
   cases and which is capable of capturing the experimentally observed
   abrupt tensile-shear transition. In a large strain finite element
   context, remeshing enables to trace the crack geometry as well as to
   preserve an adequate element shape. Stability of the computations is an
   important issue during crack propagation that can be compromised by two
   factors, i.e. large stress redistributions during the crack opening and
   the transfer of variables between meshes. A numerical procedure is
   developed that renders crack propagation considerably more robust,
   independently of the mesh fineness and crack discretisation. A
   consistent transfer algorithm and a crack relaxation method are proposed
   and implemented for this purpose. Finally, illustrative simulations are
   compared with published experimental results to highlight the features
   mentioned. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work is to evaluate the influence of strip defects

   tests were performed using carbon-epoxy single-lap bonded joints.
   Numerical simulations included interface finite elements and a
   mixed-mode damage model based on the indirect use of fracture mechanics.
   The interface finite elements allow the calculation of stresses at the
   adherend-adhesive interfaces and the damage model allows the simulation
   of damage initiation and growth. The application of the model to a
   single-lap joint is presented. The influence of a defect on the stress
   fields, joint strength and type of failure was evaluated. It was
   verified that specific strength of the joints was not affected by the
   size of the defect. The numerical results showed good agreement with the

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{From a public health perspective, developing a detailed mechanistic
   understanding of the well-known increase with age in fracture risk of
   human bone is essential. This also represents a challenge from materials
   science and fracture mechanics viewpoints. Bone has a complex,
   hierarchical structure with characteristic features ranging from
   nanometer to macroscopic dimensions; it is therefore significantly more
   complex than most engineering materials. Nevertheless, by examining the
   micro-/nanostructural changes accompanying the process of aging using
   appropriate multiscale experimental methods and relating them to
   fracture mechanics data, it is possible to obtain a quantitative picture
   of how bone resists fracture. As human cortical bone exhibits rising ex
   vivo crack-growth resistance with crack extension, its fracture
   toughness must be evaluated in terms of resistance-curve (R-curve)
   behavior. While the crack initiation toughness declines with age, the
   more striking finding is that the crack-growth toughness declines even
   more significantly and is essentially absent in bone from donors
   exceeding 85 years in age. To explain such an age-induced deterioration
   in the toughness of bone, we evaluate its fracture properties at
   multiple length scales, specifically at the molecular and nano
   dimensions using vibrational spectroscopies, at the microscale using
   electron microscopy and hard/soft x-ray computed tomography, and at the
   macroscale using R-curve measurements. We show that the reduction in
   crack-growth toughness is associated primarily with a degradation in the
   degree of extrinsic toughening, in particular involving crack bridging,
   and that this occurs at relatively coarse size scales in the range of
   tens to hundreds of micrometers. Finally, we briefly describe how
   specific clinical treatments, e.g., with steroid hormones to treat
   various inflammatory conditions, can prematurely damage bone, thereby
   reducing its fracture resistance, whereas regulating the level of the
   cytokine Transforming Growth Factor-beta can offer significant
   improvements in the stiffness, strength, and toughness of bone and as
   such may be considered a therapeutic target to treat increased bone
   fragility induced by aging, drugs, and disease.}},
