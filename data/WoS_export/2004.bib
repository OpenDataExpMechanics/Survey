Abstract = {{In this paper, a comprehensive methodology for locating and determining
   the extent of linear cracks in homogeneous plates based on the
   time-of-flight analysis of Lamb wave propagation is proposed.
   Piezoelectric sensors and actuators (PZTs) placed on a square grid
   configuration are used to excite and receive direct and reflected waves.
   The actuation frequency, spacing of PZTs and length of the signal to
   analyze are first determined. The grid is used to sweep across the plate
   to identify the location of a crack, if there is one. Elliptical loci of
   possible crack positions are constructed based on the flight time of
   crack-reflected waves estimated using energy spectra from the
   Hilbert-Huang transform of the sensor signals. A detailed procedure for
   obtaining the ellipses is described, including the blind zones. After
   identifying the crack position, the crack orientation is determined by
   varying the positions of the PZTs and observing the strength of the
   energy peaks in the Hilbert spectra. This provides the basis for moving
   the PZTs to estimate the extent of the crack. Experimental results
   obtained using aluminum plates with through, half-through and concealed
   cracks showed that the proposed method is feasible and accurate.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental method to determine the stress-elongation relation for a
   thin adhesive layer loaded in peel is presented. The method is based on
   equilibrium of the energetic forces acting on a DCB-specimen. These
   energetic forces are identified to be associated with the geometrical
   positions of the acting loads and the start of the adhesive layer. The
   first energetic force is shown to be given by the product of the force
   and the rotation of the loading point. The second energetic force is
   shown to be given by the area under the stress-elongation curve for the
   adhesive layer. Using equilibrium of these energetic forces, the shape
   of the stress-elongation curve is determined. A test set-up is developed
   to facilitate the experiments. Special consideration is given to the
   accuracy of the measurement of the elongation of the adhesive. Results
   from two sets of experiments with slightly varying geometry are
   presented. The main result is that the stress-elongation relation can be
   described by a curve divided into three parts; initially the stress
   increases proportionally to the elongation. This corresponds to a linear
   elastic behaviour of the layer. The next part is given by a constant
   limiting stress. The curve ends with a parabolically softening part.
   After this point, a crack has been initiated in the adhesive. The
   experimental results are first compared to an asymptotic analysis using
   linear elastic fracture mechanics. This shows that the new method to
   evaluate the fracture energy gives consistent results. The experiments
   are also simulated using the measured stress-elongation law. Good
   agreement with the experiments is achieved which further validates the
   method. The fracture energy and the maximum peel stress are found to
   agree well within each set of experiments. Some variation is found
   between the two sets. This is accredited to differences in fracture
   initiation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All. rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{41}},

Pages = {{833-847}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The rock mass failure process is characterized by several distinct
   deformation stages which include crack initiation, crack propagation and
   coalescence. It is important to know the stress levels associated with
   these deformation stages for engineering design and practice.
   Extensive theoretical, experimental and numerical studies on the failure
   process of intact rocks exist. It is generally understood that crack
   initiation starts at 0.3 to 0.5 times the peak uniaxial compressive
   stress. In confined conditions, the constant-deviatoric stress criterion
   was found to describe the crack initiation stress level.
   Here, generalized crack initiation and crack damage thresholds of rock
   masses are proposed. The crack initiation threshold is defined by
   sigma(1) - sigma(3) = A sigma(cm) and the crack damage threshold is
   defined by sigma(1) - sigma(3) = B sigma(cm) for jointed rock masses,
   where A and B are material constants and sigma(cm) is the uniaxial
   compressive strength of the rock masses. For a massive rock mass without
   joints, sigma(cm) is equal to sigma(cd), the long-term uniaxial strength
   of intact rock. After examining data from intact rocks and jointed rock
   masses, it was found that for massive to moderately jointed rock masses,
   the material constants A and B are in the range of 0.4 to 0.5, 0.8 to
   0.9, respectively, and for moderately to highly jointed rock masses, A
   and B are in the range of 0.5 to 0.6, 0.9 to 1.0, respectively. The
   generalized crack initiation and crack damage thresholds, when combined
   with simple linear elastic stress analysis, assist in assessing the rock
   mass integrity in low confinement conditions, greatly reducing the
   effort needed to obtain the required material constants for engineering
   design of underground excavations. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{BONE}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Two major mechanisms that could potentially be responsible for
   toughening in mineralized tissues, such as bone and dentin, have been
   identified-microcracking and crack bridging. While evidence has been
   reported for both mechanisms, there has been no consensus thus far on
   which mechanism plays the dominant role in toughening these materials.
   In the present study, we seek to present definitive experimental
   evidence supporting crack bridging, rather than microcracking, as the
   most significant mechanism of toughening in cortical bone and dentin. In
   vitro fracture toughness experiments were conducted to measure the
   variation of the fracture resistance with crack extension
   {[}resistance-curve (R-curve) behavior] for both materials with special
   attention paid to changes in the sample compliance. Because these two
   toughening mechanisms induce opposite effects on the sample compliance,
   such experiments allow for the definitive determination of the dominant
   toughening mechanism, which in the present study was found to be crack
   bridging for microstructurally large crack sizes. The results of this
   work are of relevance from the perspective of developing a
   micromechanistic framework for understanding fracture behavior of
   mineralized tissue and in predicting failure in vivo. (C) 2004 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The World-Wide Failure Exercise (WWFE) contained a detailed assessment
   of 19 theoretical approaches for predicting the deformation and failure
   response of polymer composite laminates when subjected to complex states

   theories can be best utilised to provide safe and economic predictions
   in a wide range of engineering design applications. Further guidance is
   provided for designers on the level of confidence and bounds of
   applicability of the current theories. The need for careful
   interpretation of initial failure predictions is emphasised, as is the
   need to allow for multiple sources of non-linearity (including
   progressive damage) where accuracy is sought for certain classes of
   large deformation and final failure strength predictions. Aspects
   requiring further experimental and theoretical investigation are
   identified. Direction is also provided to the research community by
   highlighting specific, tightly focussed, experimental and theoretical
   studies that, if carried out in the very near future, would pay great
   dividends from the designer's perspective, by increasing their

Abstract = {{Results from a systematic study of damage in material structures

   made on model flat-layer specimens fabricated from various dental
   ceramic combinations bonded to dentin-like polymer substrates, in
   bilayer (ceramic/polymer) and trilayer (ceramic/ceramic/polymer)
   configurations. The specimens are loaded at their top surfaces with
   spherical indenters, in simulation of occlusal function. The onset of
   fracture is observed in situ using a video camera system mounted beneath
   the transparent polymer substrate. Critical loads to induce fracture and
   deformation at the ceramic top and bottom surfaces are measured as
   functions of layer thickness and contact duration. Radial cracking at
   the ceramic undersurface occurs at relatively low loads, especially in
   thinner layers. Fracture mechanics relations are used to confirm the
   experimental data trends, and to provide explicit dependencies of
   critical loads in terms of key variables: material-elastic modulus,
   hardness, strength and toughness: geometric-layer thicknesses and
   contact radius. Tougher, harder and (especially) stronger materials show
   superior damage resistance. Critical loads depend strongly
   (quadratically) on crown net thickness. The analytic relations provide a
   sound basis for the materials design of next-generation dental crowns.

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A micromechanical model is proposed to study the deformation and failure
   process of rock based on knowledge of heterogeneity of rock at the
   mesoscopic level. In this numerical model, the heterogeneity of rock at
   the mesoscopic level is considered by assuming the material properties
   in rock conform to the Weibull distribution. Elastic damage mechanics is
   used to describe the constitutive law of meso-level elements, the finite
   element method is employed as the basic stress analysis tool and the
   maximum tensile strain criterion as well as the Mohr-Coulomb criterion
   is utilized as the damage threshold. A simple method, similar to a
   smeared crack model, is used for tracing the crack propagation process
   and interaction of multiple cracks. Based on this model, a numerical
   simulation program named Rock Failure Process Analysis Code (RFPA) is
   developed. The influence of parameters that include the Weibull
   distribution parameters, constitutive parameters of meso-level elements
   and number of elements in the numerical model, are discussed in detail.
   It is shown that the homogeneity index is the most important factor to
   simulate material failure with this model. This model is able to capture
   the complete mechanical responses of rock, which includes the crack
   patterns associated with different loading stages and loading
   conditions, localization of deformation, stress redistribution and
   failure process. The numerical simulation of rock specimens under a
   variety of static loading conditions is presented, and the results
   compare well with experimental results.}},

   detection algorithms, tuned to the specific method used for structural
   interrogation, are discussed. In the wave propagation approach, the
   pulse-echo and acousto-ultrasonic methods were considered. Reflections
   from seeded cracks were successfully recorded. In addition, acoustic
   emission and low-velocity impact were also detected. In the E/M
   impedance method approach, the high-frequency spectrum is processed
   using overall-statistics damage metrics. The (1-R(2))(3) damage metric,
   where R is the correlation coefficient, was found to yield the best
   results. The simultaneous use of the E/M impedance method in the near
   field and of the wave propagation method in the far field opens the way
   for a comprehensive multifunctional damage detection system for aging
   aircraft structural health monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Fine-pitch ball grid array (BGA) and underfills have been used in benign
   office environments and wireless applications for a number of years,
   however their reliability in automotive underhood environment is not
   well understood. In this work, the reliability of fine-pitch plastic
   ball grid array (PBGA) packages has been evaluated in the automotive
   underhood environment. Experimental studies indicate that the
   coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) as measured by thermomechanical
   analyzer (TMA) typically starts to change at 10-15 degreesC lower
   temperature than the T-g specified by differential scanning calorimetry
   (DSC) potentially extending the change in CTE well into the accelerated
   test envelope in the neighborhood of 125 degreesC. High T-g substrates
   with glass-transition temperatures much higher than the 125 degreesC
   high temperature limit, are therefore not subject to the effect of high
   coefficient of thermal expansion close to the high temperature of the
   accelerated test. Darveaux's damage relationships {[}1]-{[}3] were
   derived on ceramic ball grid array (CBGA) assemblies, with predominantly
   solder mask defined (SMD) pads and 62Sn36Pb2Ag solder. In addition to
   significant differences in the crack propagation paths for the two pad
   constructions, SMD pads fail significantly faster than the non solder
   mask defined (NSMD) pads in thermal fatigue. The thermal mismatch on
   CBGAs is much larger than PBGA assemblies. Crack propagation in CBGAs is
   often observed predominantly on the package side as opposed to both
   package and board side for PBGAs. In the present study, crack
   propagation data has been acquired on assemblies with 15, 17, and 23 mm
   size plastic BGAs with NSMD pads and 63Sn37Pb on high-T-g printed
   circuit boards. The data has been benchmarked against Darveaux's data on
   CBGA assemblies. Experimental matrix also encompasses the effect of
   bis-maleimide triazine (BT) substrate thickness on reliability. Damage
   constants have been developed and compared against existing Darveaux
   Constants. Prediction error has been quantified for both sets of
   constants.}},

   workpiece material properties, cutting speed, and tool geometry. The
   understanding of chip formation plays an important role in machining
   process optimization and surface integrity. Discontinuous chips, one of
   the major chip types, are usually formed in hard machining at high
   speeds. In this study, a new method has been presented to simulate
   discontinuous chips in high-speed machining AISI 4340 (32 HRc). The
   workpiece material properties have been modeled using the Johnson-Cook
   (JC) plasticity model, and material crack formation and propagation
   simulated using the Johnson-Cook damage model. It has been shown that
   discontinuous chip is due to the internal crack initiation and
   propagation in front of the tool and above the cutting edge, rather than
   from the free surface. The simulated chip morphology correlated well

Abstract = {{The effect of Fe-content on the fatigue damage evolution in a cast
   A356-T6 alloy was investigated both experimentally and through
   microscale finite element simulations. High cycle fatigue tests
   indicated that iron content has little influence on the fatigue life in
   the short lifetime regime (<10(5) cycles) but it significantly reduces
   the fatigue life in the long lifetime regime (>106-cycles). At high
   applied stress levels in the short lifetime regime, fatigue life is
   dominated by the crack propagation stage. The large plate-like Fe-rich
   intermetallic particles in high Fe-content castings were observed
   metallographically to retard the growth of small cracks through crack
   branching and meandering. For the long lifetime regime, the crack
   initiation stage is important. Fracture surface examination and finite
   element analysis revealed that in the absence of other defects such as
   porosity or oxide films, the large plate-like Fe-rich intermetallic
   particles in high Fe-content castings promote crack initiation by
   raising the stress-strain concentration in the eutectic region. Based on
   experimental observations and finite element analysis, a
   microstructure-based model was developed involving crack initiation and
   propagation, which allows quantitative assessment of the influence of
   Fe-content on the fatigue life. Good agreement was obtained between the
   model and experimental results. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Six different, industrially important, casting situations containing an
   array of typical microstructure and defects were investigated. Porosity,
   secondary dendrite arm spacing, Al-matrix, Si-particles, and Fe-rich
   intermetallics were experimentally identified as the major factors
   affecting the alloy's resistance to fatigue. A micro-cell model was
   developed to quantitatively investigate the effect of these factors on
   fatigue resistance. The micro-cell captures the key microstructural
   features and is embedded into a macro material element at the specimen
   surface. A nonlinear isotropic/kinematic hardening law was used to
   describe the cyclic plastic behavior of the Al-matrix. This model
   enables the quantification of the accumulation and concentration of the
   microscale plastic deformation induced during fatigue loading by
   microstructural heterogeneities. The simulation results demonstrate that
   microscale plastic damage could occur even when the maximum far-field
   stress is below the nominal yield stress of the alloy. The degree of
   fatigue damage, in terms of the accumulation of plastic damage
   dissipation energy, was found to be sensitive to the microstructural
   features. Fatigue strength was estimated using the model and found to be

Abstract = {{Low-velocity impact tests were performed on fibreglass-aluminium
   composites made of 2024 T3 sheets and S2-glass/epoxy prepreg layers,
   using an instrumented falling weight machine. For comparison purposes,
   similar tests were carried out on monolithic 2024 T3 sheets of
   equivalent thickness. In the tests, the impact speed, mass, and energy
   were varied, to ascertain the influence of these parameters on the
   material response. From the results obtained, the overall
   force-displacement curve only depends on the impact energy, rather than
   on the mass and speed separately. Further, the energy required for
   penetration is higher for monolithic aluminium than for the
   fibreglass-aluminium. However, the latter material seems to offer better
   performance than carbon fibre- and glass fibre-reinforced laminates in
   terms of penetration energy, damage resistance, and inspectability. The
   main failure modes of fibreglass-aluminium were assessed by both
   ultrasonic C-scan and chemical grinding of aluminium sheets. It was
   found that the energy required for first failure is very low, whereas
   the energy level resulting in first fibre failure is similar to that
   inducing first cracking in the 2024 T3 sheets. From the experimental
   data, simple empirical relationships were found for the calculation of
   maximum contact force, energy, and residual displacement as a function
   of the maximum displacement. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The use of interface finite elements and a damage model are proposed to
   predict damage due to low velocity impact in carbon-epoxy (0(4), 90(4)),
   laminates. Experimentally, some impact tests were performed using a drop
   weight testing machine and a damage characterisation was done using
   X-rays. Impact-induced delamination and matrix cracks were found to be
   the most detrimental damage modes in laminated composites. The numerical
   model developed is based on an interface finite element compatible with
   three-dimensional solid elements, which allows to model delamination
   between layers and matrix cracking inside layers. The damage model is
   based on the indirect use of fracture mechanics considering a softening
   stress-relative displacements equation and permits to simulate the
   initiation and propagation of damage avoiding the definition of initial
   flaws. The progressive damage model successfully simulated the
   interaction between the crack due to bending and delamination. Good
   agreement between experimental and numerical analysis for shape,
   orientation and size of the delamination was obtained. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The present study performs the small area electro-discharge machining
   (EDM) process with a low wear-rate copper-tungsten electrode of diameter
   1.5 mm to establish the influence of the EDM parameters on various
   aspects of the surface integrity of AISI 1045 carbon steel. The residual
   stress induced by the EDM process is measured using the Hole-Drilling
   Strain-Gage Method. The experimental results reveal that the values of
   material removal rate (MRR), surface roughness (SR), hole enlargement
   (HE), average white layer thickness (WLT), and induced residual stress
   tend to increase at higher values of pulse current and pulse-on
   duration. However, for an extended pulse-on duration, it is noted that
   the MRR, SR, and surface crack density all decrease. Furthermore, the
   results indicate that obvious cracks are always evident in thicker white
   layers. A smaller pulse current (i.e. 1 A) tends to increase the surface
   crack density, while a prolonged pulse-on duration (i.e. 23 mus) widens
   the opening degree of the surface crack, thereby reducing the surface
   crack density. The EDM hole drilling process induces a compressive
   residual stress within the workpiece. A linear relationship is
   identified between the maximum residual stress and the average white
   layer thickness. It is determined that the residual stress can be
   controlled effectively by specifying an appropriate pulse-on duration.

Abstract = {{Seven German and three Hungarian monumental sandstones have been tested
   in laboratory conditions to analyse the effect of heat. The studied
   quartz sandstones have a wide-range of cements and grain-sizes including
   silica-, carbonate-, clay- and ferrous mineral-cemented varieties of
   fine-, medium- to coarse-grained types. Cylindrical specimens were
   heated up to 150, 300, 450, 600, 750 and 900degreesC in an oven. The
   mineralogical and textural changes were recorded and compared by using
   microscopy, XRD, DTA-DTG and SEM. Colours and colour differences (a{*},
   b{*}, L{*} values) were also measured and evaluated. Colour changes are
   related to mineral transformations. The most intense colour change is
   caused by the oxidation of iron-bearing minerals to hematite that takes
   place up to 900degreesC. When temperature increases the green glauconite
   becomes brownish while the chlorite changes to yellowish at first. The
   colour of burnt sandstone is not a direct indicator of burning
   temperature, since there are sandstones in which the burnt specimens are
   lighter and less reddish than the natural ones. Porosity increase is
   related to micro-cracking at grain boundaries (above 600degreesC) and
   within the grains (at and above 750degreesC) and mineral
   transformations. The clay mineral structure collapses at different
   temperatures (kaolinite up to 600degreesC, chlorite above 600degreesC)
   and leads to a slight increase in porosity. The most drastic change is
   observed in calcite cemented sandstones where the carbonate structure
   collapses at 750degreesC and CaO appears at 900degreesC. Subsequently it
   is transformed to portlandite due to absorption of water vapour from the
   air. This leads to the disintegration of sandstone at room temperature a
   few days after the heat shock.}},

Abstract = {{An irreversible cohesive-decohesive constitutive law is postulated for

   diffusion coefficients were found to be only slightly dependent on
   reinforcement configuration. The delamination threshold load and impact
   energy absorption were not significantly affected by the absorbed water.
   Due to low fibre-matrix adhesion, the prevailing failure modes at low
   impact energy were fibre/matrix debonding and interfacial cracking. The
   compression strength suffered significant reductions with water absorbed
   (28\%) and impact (maximum 42\%). The least sensitive to impact damage

Abstract = {{Masonry may be considered macroscopically as a periodic two-phase
   material. The possible occurrence of cracking in each of the phases
   leads to a complex mechanical behaviour. Most existing macroscopic
   models defined for such materials are phenomenological and either
   isotropic or orthotropic. In this paper, a scalar damage model is used
   in a mesoscopic study to assess the need for incorporating
   non-orthotropic induced anisotropy in macrocopic models. Based on unit
   cell computations and homogenization techniques under a plane stress
   assumption, it is shown that scalar damage meso-models allow to obtain
   realistic in-plane damage patterns encountered in experiments. Results
   suggest that at the meso-scale, it is possible to use a scalar damage
   model for the individual phases which naturally leads to an overall
   anisotropy evolution. This evolving macroscopic anisotropy is
   illustrated using a numerical homogenization procedure to identify the
   degraded stiffness associated to the obtained damage patterns. It is
   shown that the characteristic anisotropic shape of experimental failure
   envelopes for masonry may be reproduced by unit cell computations, as
   far as in-plane failure mechanisms are concerned. (C) 2004 Elsevier SAS.

Abstract = {{The plastic deformation behavior of aluminum casting alloys A356 and
   A357 has been investigated at Various solidification rates with or
   without Sr Modification using monotonic tensile and multi-loop tensile
   and compression testing. The results indicate that at low plastic
   strains, the eutectic particle aspect ratio and matrix strength dominate
   the work hardening, while at large plastic strains, the hardening rate
   depends on secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS). For the alloys
   studied, the average internal stresses increase very rapidly at small
   plastic strains and gradually saturate at large plastic strains.
   Elongated eutectic particles, small SDAS, or high matrix strength result
   in a high saturation value. The difference in the internal stresses, due
   to different microstructural features, determines the rate of eutectic
   particle cracking and, in turn, the tensile instability of the alloys.
   The higher the internal stresses, the higher the damage rate of particle
   cracking and then the lower the Young's modulus. The fracture strain of
   alloys A356/357 corresponds to the critical amount of damage by particle
   cracking locally or globally, irrespective of the fineness of the
   microstructure. In the coarse structure (large SDAS), this critical
   amount of damage is easily reached, due to the clusters of large and
   elongated particles, leading to alloy fracture before global necking.
   However, in the alloy with the small SDAS, the critical amount of damage
   is postponed until global necking takes place due to the small and round
   particles. Current models for dispersion hardening can be used to
   calculate the stresses induced in the particles. The calculations agree
   well with the results inferred from the experimental results.}},

   experimental results showed that the thermal damage of HCP was not only

   to the formation of dehydration-induced microcracks. These damage
   mechanisms, together with three other types of macrocracks arisen from
   the mismatch of expansion/shrinkage between the phase materials (HCP and
   aggregates) contributed to the thermal damage of the mortar. By
   comparing the evolution of the stress-strain curves for the HCP and the
   companion mortar specimens, the effects of the damage mechanisms could
   be separately quantified. In this study, the thermal damage of the
   mortar specimens was largely caused by the thermal mismatch mechanism.

Abstract = {{The prediction of the central burst defects in axisymmetric cold
   extrusion is analyzed numerically by using 2D finite element analysis
   (FEA) accounting for the ductile damage effect. The coupling between the
   ductile damage and the thermoelastoplastic constitutive equations is
   formulated in the framework of the thermodynamics of irreversible
   processes together with the continuum damage mechanics (CDM) theory. A
   simple isotropic ductile damage model is fully coupled with
   thermoelastoplastic constitutive equations of Prandtl-Reuss type
   including non-linear isotropic hardening and thermal effects. A modified
   ductile damage criterion based on linear combination of the stress
   tensor invariants is proposed in order to predict the occurrence of
   micro-crack initiation as a discontinuous central bursts along the bar
   axis. The implicit integration scheme of the fully coupled constitutive
   equations and the iterative resolution scheme to solve the associated
   thermomechanical equilibrium problem are presented. A three fields
   (velocity, hydrostatic pressure and temperature) variational formulation
   is used to solve the resulting algebraic system. The effects of various
   process parameters, namely, the diameter reduction ratio, the die
   semi-angle, the friction coefficient and the material ductility,..., on
   the central bursts occurrence are discussed. The quantitative effects of
   ductile damage on the extrusion parameters are studied and qualitative
   comparison with some available experimental data are given. (C) 2004

Abstract = {{The high cycle fatigue behaviour of a nodular cast iron has been
   investigated under tension loading. Casting defects are at the origin of
   crack initiation for all samples tested. Critical defects (shrinkage)
   are located either at the surface or within the bulk. The role of the
   size and position of natural defect on the fatigue limit has been
   established. Results show that, for a given size, internal defects are
   less damaging than surface located ones. SEM observations revealed the
   existence of non-propagating surface cracks below the fatigue limit. By
   means of a marking technique, the 3D shape of these cracks initiated
   around the defects was fully described. In an attempt to simulate the
   evolution of the fatigue limit with defect size, some existing
   approaches are compared to experimental data; it is shown that 2D
   analysis of defects (crack or notch) is conservative. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A theoretical and experimental study of the response of a damaged
   Euler-Bernoulli beam traversed by a moving mass is presented. Damage is
   modelled through rotational springs whose compliance is evaluated using
   linear elastic fracture mechanics. The analytical solution is based on
   the series expansion of the unknown deflection in a basis of the beam
   eigenfunctions. The latter are calculated using the transfer matrix
   method, taking into account the effective mass distribution of the beam.
   The convective acceleration terms, often omitted in similar studies, are
   considered here for a correct evaluation of the beam-moving mass
   interaction force.
   The analytical solution is then validated through a series of
   experimental tests. An adequate small-scale model is designed to satisfy
   both static and dynamic similitude with a prototype bridge structure,
   thus providing data of practical engineering relevance. It is shown that
   experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical
   predictions. Moreover, it is observed that the percentages of variation
   in the beam response due to damage are, generally, larger than those
   induced in the structural natural frequencies; that is, an increase in
   structural damage sensitivity is noticed under the effect of a moving
   interacting load. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A modified non-local damage model with evolving internal length,
   inspired from micromechanics, is developed. It is shown in particular
   that the non-local influence between two points in the damaged material
   depends on the value of damage at each of these points. The resulting
   weight function is non-symmetric and truncated. Finite element results
   and strain localization analysis on a one-dimensional problem are
   presented and compared to those of the original non-local damage model.
   It is shown that in the course of damage localization, the incremental
   strain profiles expand according to the modified non-local model,
   instead of shrinking according to the original constitutive relation.
   Comparisons with experimental data on model materials with controlled
   porosity are also discussed. Acoustic emission analyses provide results
   with which the theoretical model is consistent qualitatively. This model
   also opens the path for durability mechanics analyses, where it has been
   demonstrated that the internal length in the non-local model should

Abstract = {{Following a literature review, the paper outlines the development of a
   3D finite element model for the turning of Inconel 718 using
   ABAQUS/Explicit as a precursor to ball end milling simulation. The model
   employed a Lagrangian formulation. The workpiece material property data
   were determined from experimental work on a Gleeble thermo-mechanical
   simulator using uniaxial compression testing, with temperatures and
   strain rates of up to 850degreesC and 100 s(-1), respectively. Predicted
   and measured forces were within 6\% for the tangential component, while
   feed forces were within 29\%. The actual chip morphology determined from
   quick-stop experiments was segmented, whereas the predicted profile was
   continuous, irrespective of the cutting speed. It is likely that the
   discrepancies were a result of over-simplification of the friction model
   together with inadequacies in the algorithms describing the material
   behaviour. A user sub-routine which contains a `damage criterion' to
   initiate crack propagation has been highlighted as a requirement to
   simulate chip segmentation. Details of preliminary work on the 3D ball
   nose end milling of Inconel 718 are also presented, which underline the
   difficulties inherent in this approach, together with geometry and mesh
   considerations. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A progressive failure methodology is developed and demonstrated to
   simulate the initiation and material degradation of a laminated panel
   due to intralaminar and interlaminar failures. Initiation of
   intralaminar failure can be by a matrix-cracking mode, a fiber-matrix
   shear mode, and a fiber failure mode. Subsequent material degradation is
   modeled using damage parameters for each mode to selectively reduce
   lamina material properties. The interlaminar failure mechanism such as
   delamination is simulated by positioning interface elements between
   adjacent sublaminates. A nonlinear constitutive law is postulated for
   the interface element that accounts for a multi-axial stress criteria to
   detect the initiation of delamination, a mixed-mode fracture criteria
   for delamination progression, and a damage parameter to prevent
   restoration of a previous cohesive state. The methodology is validated
   using experimental data available in the literature on the response and
   failure of quasi-isotropic panels with centrally located circular
   cutouts loaded into the postbuckling regime. Very good agreement between
   the progressive failure analyses and the experimental results is
   achieved if the failure analyses includes the interaction of

   interactions between die design, forming parameters (i.e. ram speed,
   container temperature, billet temperature and extrusion ratio) and the
   product qualities (extrudate shape, surface condition and
   microstructure) by the use of finite element modelling (FEM). The
   various models (such as recrystallisation, damage criteria, etc.) have
   been integrated into the commercial codes, FORGE2(R) and FORGE3(R),
   through user routines. The physical recrystallisation model proposed by
   Sellars and Zhu {[}Mater. Sci. Eng. A280 (2000) 1] and Value et al.
   {[}Acta Mater. 44 (1996) 4463] have been compared. The predicted
   distributions of the volume fraction recrystallised were also compared
   with the experimental results from the literature. The influences of
   forming parameters on the occurrence of surface cracks were studied by
   the combination of the Taguchi method with the FEM. It was found that
   the choked die could significantly reduce the possibility of producing
   surface cracks. Through simulating a shape extrusion process using two
   different die structures, it was found that the use of an expansion
   chamber can significantly reduce the degree of non-uniformity in terms
   of the extruded product shape and properties. The character of the
   complex material flow is also identifiable, which is very useful to help
   improve die design. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Weakly bonded particle mixtures of mullite and alumina are assessed as
   candidate matrixes for use in porous matrix ceramic composites.
   Conditions for the deflection of a matrix crack at a fiber-matrix
   interface are used to identify the combinations of modulus and toughness
   of the fibers and the matrix for which damage-tolerant behavior is
   expected to occur in the composite. Accordingly, the present study
   focuses on the modulus and toughness of the particle mixtures, as well
   as the changes in these properties following aging at elevated
   temperature comparable to the targeted upper-use temperature for oxide
   composites. Models based on bonded particle aggregates are presented,
   assessed, and calibrated. The experimental and modeling results are
   combined to predict the critical aging times at which damage tolerance
   is lost because of sintering at the particle junctions and the
   associated changes in mechanical properties. For an aging temperature of
   1200degreesC, the critical time exceeds 10 000 h for the mullite-rich
   mixtures.}},

Abstract = {{Delamination is one of the predominant forms of failure in laminated
   composite structures, especially when there is no reinforcement in the
   thickness direction. To develop composite structures that are more
   damage tolerant, it is necessary to understand how delamination
   develops, and how it can affect the residual performance. A number of
   factors such as residual thermal stresses, matrix-curing shrinkage and
   manufacturing defects affect how damage will grow in a composite
   structure. It is important to develop computationally efficient analysis
   methods that can account for all such factors. The objective of the
   current work is to apply a newly developed decohesion element to
   investigate the debond strength of skin-stiffener composite specimens.
   The process of initiation of delaminations and the propagation of
   delamination fronts is investigated. The numerical predictions are
   compared with published experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{The results of 32 tests on bolted T-stub connections made up of welded
   plates are presented and discussed. Although T-stubs have been used for
   many years to model the tension zone of bolted joints, the research was
   mainly concentrated on rolled profiles as T-stub elements. To extend
   this model to the case of welded plates as T-stub elements, a test
   programme was undertaken at the Delft University of Technology and is
   reported in this paper. It provides insight into the behaviour of this
   different type of assembly, in terms of resistance, stiffness,
   deformation capacity and failure modes, in particular. The key variables
   tested include the weld throat thickness, the size of the T-stub, the
   type and diameter of the bolts, the steel grade, the presence of
   transverse stiffeners and the T-stub orientation. The results show that
   the welding procedure is particularly important to ensure a ductile
   behaviour of the connection. Most of the T-stubs failed by tension
   fracture of the bolts after significant yielding of the flanges.
   However, some of the specimens have shown early damage of the plate
   material near the weld toe due to the effect of the welding consumable
   that induced premature cracking and reduced the overall deformation
   capacity. A solution to this problem is given by setting requirements to
   the weld metal to be used. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{177-186}},
Abstract = {{Grinding is a widely employed finishing process for different materials.
   It is inherently characterized by its high specific energy requirement
   unlike other machining processes. This leads to a high grinding zone
   temperature, which impairs the workpiece quality by inducing thermal
   damage in the form of surface and subsurface cracks, phase
   transformations, tensile residual stresses, etc. The microcracks and
   residual stresses induced in the surface of the ceramics during grinding
   can severely limit the application of ceramic components. This article
   deals with an investigation on using graphite as a solid lubricant to
   reduce friction and thereby improve the surface integrity of ground
   silicon carbide (SiC). An experimental setup has been developed, and
   experiments have been conducted to study the effect of using a graphite
   lubricant on the surface roughness, grinding forces, and specific energy
   while grinding SiC material. Results indicate that there is a
   considerable improvement in the performance of grinding SiC using
   graphite as a solid lubricant when compared with dry grinding in terms
   of specific energy requirements, surface roughness, and damage. The
   employment of graphite as a solid lubricant in ceramic grinding makes
   the process more economical and reliable.}},

Abstract = {{A current focus in earthquake engineering research and practice is the
   development of seismic design procedures whose aim is to achieve a
   specified performance. To implement such procedures, engineers require
   methods to define damage in terms of engineering criteria. Previous

   failure, with relatively little attention to other damage states. A
   research program was undertaken to assess the seismic performance of
   well-confined, circular-cross-section, reinforced concrete bridge
   columns at a range of damage states. The test variables included aspect
   ratio, longitudinal reinforcement ratio, spiral reinforcement ratio,
   axial load ratio, and the length of the well-confined region adjacent to
   the zone where plastic hinging is anticipated. The progression of damage
   was similar for all columns. Analysis of the experimental results
   suggest that key damage states of residual cracking, cover spalling, and
   core crushing can best be related to engineering parameters, such as
   longitudinal reinforcement tensile strain and concrete compressive
   strain, using cumulative probability curves.}},

Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{156}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{We address the gradual transition from brittle failure to cataclastic
   flow under increasing pressures by a new model, incorporating damage
   rheology with Biot's poroelasticity. Deformation of porous rocks is
   associated with growth of two classes of internal flaws, namely cracks
   and pores. Cracks act as stress concentrations promoting brittle
   failure, whereas pores dissipate stress concentrations leading to
   distributed deformation. The present analysis, based on thermodynamic
   principles, leads to a system of coupled kinetic equations for the
   evolution of damage along with porosity. Each kinetic equation
   represents competition between cracking and irreversible porosity
   change. In addition, the model correctly predicts the modes of strain
   localization such as dilating versus compacting shear bands. The model
   also reproduces shear dilatancy and the related change of fluid pressure
   under undrained conditions. For triaxial compression loading, when the
   evolution of porosity and damage is taken into consideration, fluid
   pressure first increases and then decreases, after the onset of damage.
   These predictions are in agreement with experimental observations on
   sandstones. The new development provides an internally consistent
   framework for simulating coupled evolution of fracturing and fluid flow
   in a variety of practical geological and engineering problems such as
   nucleation of deformation features in poroelastic media and fluid flow
   during the seismic cycle.}},

   The resulting formula accounts for the presence of an adhesive layer

   measurements of both the applied load and the adhesive deformation at

   deformation of the adhesive layer can be substantial. The stability of
   the ENF-specimen is studied and a method to estimate the critical value
   of the crack length, accounting for the flexibility of the adhesive
   layer, is presented. In the analysis, the adherends are modelled as

Abstract = {{The analysis of concrete structure durability is based on the
   investigation of the material long-term behaviour. Such behaviour is
   influenced by mechanical, hydrous and thermal actions applied to
   structures. The main purpose of this study concerns the characterisation
   of the coupled effects between drying shrinkage and damage for a
   cementitious material. An experimental study on a normalised mortar
   (European norm) is then presented to characterise the damage effect,
   induced by drying and desiccation shrinkage on the multiaxial
   compressive behaviour. Triaxial compression tests are carried out at
   different times of drying. The observed increase in deviatoric strength
   and decrease of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are related to the
   loss in mass of specimens. These results are commented through the
   damage processes of material because the drying phenomenon causes
   microcracking by exceeding tensile strength. This microcracking will
   have a strong influence on the damage process of the material and then
   on its failure behaviour. Furthermore, the effect of drying leads to an
   increase of the capillary suction into the mortar, hence, to an increase
   of the specimen strength. Such couplings have to be taken into account
   in a reliable modelling. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Plastic-bonded materials are composites consisting of grains of filler
   material embedded in a polymeric matrix. A micromechanics model is
   proposed for investigating the mechanical behaviour of plastic-bonded
   materials having two disparate grain sizes. A hybrid theory is proposed
   to handle some aspects of the bimodal grain size distribution. Our model
   uses the first-order method of cells with an eight-cell representative
   volume element where one of the eight cells contains a large grain and
   the seven remaining cells contain a mixture of small grains embedded in
   the polymeric binder material. A Mori-Tanaka-based analysis is used to
   describe the small grain-binder mechanical response. The small grains in
   this analysis are assumed to be spherical and uniformly distributed in
   the binder. In this work, we use the explosive PBX 9501, in its
   unreacted state, as our test system. The explosive grain particle size
   distribution of PBX 9501 consists of two broad peaks centred at
   approximately 1 and 200 mum. The constitutive behaviour of the large
   explosive grains are assumed to be elastic-plastic and damage by way of
   micro-crack brittle fracture. Only linear elasticity of the small grains
   is considered. The rate and temperature dependence of the mechanical
   response of the polymer binder is accounted for by a generalized Maxwell
   viscoelasticity model. The theoretical uniaxial stress-strain response
   for PBX 9501 is reported for quasi-static and split Hopkinson pressure
   bar loading rates and compared to experimental measurements.}},

Abstract = {{A comparison is presented of the dynamic plastic deformation and tensile
   failure of two metal-matrix composites (one with a cast alloy matrix and
   the other with a wrought alloy matrix). The two composites are ceramic
   particle reinforced aluminum alloys: F3S.20S (A359 aluminum alloy
   reinforced by 20\% SiC particles) and W6A20A (6061-T6 aluminum alloy
   reinforced by 20\% Al2O3 particles). The corresponding unreinforced
   matrix alloys were also examined. The effects of strain rate on the
   tensile responses of these composites were determined using the tension
   Kolsky bar. The microstructures and fracture surfaces of the specimens
   of each composite were examined using SEM and optical microscopy. The
   experimental results show that the flow stresses of both composites are
   higher than that of their matrix alloys, whereas the composite fracture
   strains are lower. The fracture strains of the W6A20A composite and the
   6061-T6 monolithic matrix alloy were much higher than those of the
   F3S20S composite and the A359 monolithic matrix alloy. Both the W6A20A
   composite and 6061-T6 monolithic matrix alloy behaved in a ductile
   manner with necking prior to fracture, while both the F3S.20S composite
   and A359 monolithic matrix alloy behaved in a brittle manner with no
   necking prior to fracture. Microscopic examination revealed tensile
   failure of the A359 matrix alloy and its composite to be controlled by
   the microcracking of Si network, which formed in the interdendritic
   silicon rich region, whereas failure of the 6061-T6 based composite is
   controlled by cracking of reinforcement particles. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V

   damage. The energy is estimated by power spectral density analysis and
   quantified by means of its root mean square value. These values are
   combined with mode shapes to locate damage. The method is evaluated with
   small masses used to simulate damage and or small cuts to simulate
   damage and good agreement is obtained between experiments and analysis.

Abstract = {{This work has investigated the effect of process-induced residual stress
   on bearing rolling contact fatigue (RCF). A 2-D finite element
   simulation model of bearing rolling contact has been developed to
   incorporate the process-induced residual stress profile as initial
   conditions. The applied load was modeled using the interaction between
   the roller and the bearing inner race instead of moving elastic-based
   Hertzian pressure and tangential traction across the surface. Residual
   stress profiles of an AISI 52100 steel inner race machined by hard
   turning and grinding were used to evaluate fatigue damage using the
   critical plane approach. Three cases using the simulation model were
   assessed: (a) measured residual stress by hard turning; (b) measured
   residual stress by grinding; and (c) free of residual stress. In
   addition, the sensitivity of fatigue damage to normal load, tangential
   traction, and magnitude of surface residual stress was also
   investigated. The results from simulation post-processing showed that
   these distinct residual stress profiles only affect near-surface fatigue
   damage rather than locations deeper in the subsurface. It was concluded,
   then, that residual stress affects only near-surface initiated RCF
   rather than subsurface initiated RCF, which has been demonstrated with
   some prior experimental data. Furthermore, the applied normal load has a
   significant effect on fatigue damage, while the effects of magnitudes of
   friction and surface residual stress are small. Lastly, multiaxial
   fatigue damage parameters used in conjunction with a critical plane
   approach can characterize the relative fatigue damage under the
   influence of process-induced residual stress profiles. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Meso-scale models over a range of 50-500 mum are employed for predicting
   crack growth in the creep range. They make use of fracture mechanics,
   creep damage mechanics under multi-axial loading and limit analysis
   techniques. A study is made of the several levels of approximations and
   validations in the modelling process that are needed in order to make
   the method an acceptable tool for use in a safe defect assessment
   procedure. The NSW meso-scale model developed previously has been used
   to compare crack growth rate in a 316H stainless steel tested at
   550degreesC using compact tension (CT) and centre-cracked panel (CCP)
   specimens. In this way the steady crack growth region can be explained
   by an upper/lower bound cracking rate based on the level of multiaxial
   constraint. However, the model only quantifies the upper/lower plane
   stress-strain bounds and does not quantify the intermediate levels of
   constraint. Therefore, a two-parameter concept to predict constraint and
   the various steps is employed to improve the predictions for defect
   assessment in components. Preliminary results using 2D modelling of a
   CCP specimen under plane strain conditions suggest that the method could
   be used to predict conservative estimates for crack growth rates when
   compared to experimental results. Further numerical analysis using 3D
   models of actual geometric sizes are necessary to confirm the usefulness
   of the two parameter method in defect assessment procedures. (C) 2003

   The validation of numerical simulations requires detailed knowledge of

   a simple situation, we have made and tested a thin-film system based on
   calibrated gold nanoparticles (600-nm diameter) inserted between two

Abstract = {{Failure of the bone cement mantle has been implicated in the loosening
   process of cemented hip stems. Current methods of investigating
   degradation of the cement mantle in vitro often require sectioning of
   the sample to confirm failure paths. The present research investigates
   acoustic emission as a passive experimental method for the assessment of
   bone cement failure. Damage in bone cement was monitored during four
   point bending fatigue tests through an analysis of the peak amplitude,
   duration, rise time (RT) and energy of the events emitted from the
   damage sections. A difference in AE trends was observed during failure
   for specimens aged and tested in (i) air and (ii) Ringer's solution at
   37degreesC. It was noted that the acoustic behaviour varied according to
   applied load level; events of higher duration and RT were emitted during
   fatigue at lower stresses. A good correlation was observed between crack
   location and source of acoustic emission, and the nature of the acoustic
   parameters that were most suited to bone cement failure characterisation
   was identified. The methodology employed in this study Could potentially
   be used as a pre-clinical assessment tool for the integrity of cemented
   load bearing implants. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},
