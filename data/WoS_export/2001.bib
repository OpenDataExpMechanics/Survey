Abstract = {{Recent theoretical and experimental studies demonstrated that a weakly
   or incompletely bonded interfaces exhibit highly nonlinear behavior. One
   of acoustic manifestations of such nonlinearity is the modulation of a
   probing high-frequency ultrasonic wave by low-frequency vibration. The
   vibration varies the contact area modulating the phase and amplitude of
   higher frequency probing wave passing through the interface. In the
   frequency domain, the result of this modulation manifests itself as
   side-band spectral components with respect to the frequency of the
   probing wave. This modulation effect has been observed experimentally
   for various materials (metals, composites, concrete, sandstone, glass)
   with various types of contact-type defects (interfaces): cracks,
   debondings, delaminations, and microstructural material damages. Study
   of this phenomenon revealed correlation between the developed modulation
   criterion and the quantitative characteristics of the interfaces, such
   as its size, loading condition, and bonding strength. These findings
   have been used for the development of an innovative nondestructive
   evaluation technique, namely Vibro-Acoustic Modulation Technique. Two
   modifications of this technique have been developed: Vibro-Modulation
   (VM) and Impact-Modulation (IM), employing CW and impact-induced
   vibrations, respectively. The examples of applications of these methods
   include crack detection in steel pipes, aircraft and auto parts, bonded
   composite plates etc. These methods also proved their effectiveness in
   the detection of cracks in concrete. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

   Synchrotron X-ray tomography has been used to characterise in three

   of a crack from a pore has been identified. The crack propagation at
   high stress level appears to be quite insensitive to microstructural
   barriers and can be reasonably well described by a Paris type law. At
   low stresses, however, short cracks are often observed to be stopped at
   grain boundaries and the fatigue life is no longer predicted by a simple

Abstract = {{A study on the accuracy of cohesive models for capturing dynamic
   fragmentation of ceramic microstructures is presented. The investigation
   consists of a combined experimental/numerical approach in which
   microcracking and damage kinetics are examined by means of plate impact
   recovery experiments. The numerical analysis is based on a 2-D
   micromechanical stochastic finite element analysis. The model
   incorporates a cohesive law to capture microcrack initiation,
   propagation and coalescence, as well as crack interaction and branching,
   as a natural outcome of the calculated material response. The
   stochasticity of the microfracture process is modeled by introducing a
   Weibull distribution of interfacial strength at grain boundaries. This
   model accounts for randomness in grain orientation, and the existence of
   chemical impurities and glassy phase at grain boundaries. Representative
   volume elements (RVE) of ceramic microstructure with different grain
   size and shape distributions are considered to account for features
   observed in real microstructures. Normal plate impact velocity histories
   are used not only to identify model parameters, but also to determine
   under what conditions the model captures failure mechanisms
   experimentally observed. The analyses show that in order to capture
   damage kinetics a particular distribution of grain boundary strength and
   detailed modeling of grain morphology are required. Simulated microcrack
   patterns and velocity histories have been found to be in a good
   agreement with the experimental observations only when the right grain
   morphology and model parameters are chosen. It has been found that the
   addition of rate effects to the cohesive model results in microcrack
   diffusion not observed experimentally. (C) 2001 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{This paper describes the utilization of Electro-Mechanical (E/M)
   impedance method for structural health monitoring of thin plates. The
   method allows the direct identification of structural dynamics by
   obtaining its E/M impedance or admittance signatures. The analytical
   model for two-dimensional structure was developed and verified with
   experiments. Good matching of experimental results and calculated
   spectra was obtained for axial and flexural components. The ability of
   the method to identify the presence of damage was investigated by
   performing an experiment where the damage in the form of crack was
   simulated with an EDM slit placed at various distances from the sensor.
   It was found that the crack presence dramatically modifies the E/M
   impedance spectrum and this modification decreases as the distance
   between the sensor and the crack increases. Several overall-statistics
   damage metrics, which may be used for on-line structural heath
   monitoring, were investigated. Among these candidate damage metrics, the
   alphath power of the correlation coefficient deviation, CCDalpha, 3 <
   \&alpha; < 7, used in the high frequency band 300-450 kHz, was found to
   be most successful. Careful selection of the high frequency band and

Abstract = {{Objective: To compare the histopathologic changes in the human

   frequency-doubled, neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser.
   Design: Human ``in vitro{''} experimental study.
   Tissue and Controls: Eight human autopsy eyes were obtained within 18
   hours of death from persons aged 71 to 78 years.
   Methods: The anterior segment of autopsy eyes was isolated, and one half
   of each trabecular meshwork underwent SLT and the other half ALT,
   Specimens were evaluated with scanning and transmission electron
   microscopy.
   Main Outcome Measures: Structural changes in the TM were detected by
   scanning electron microscopy, and cellular or intracellular changes were
   seen with transmission electron microscopy.
   Results: Evaluation of the TM after ALT revealed crater formation in the
   uveal meshwork at the junction of the pigmented and nonpigmented TM,
   Coagulative damage was evident at the base and along the edge of
   craters, with disruption of the collagen beams, fibrinous exudate, lysis
   of endothelial cells, and nuclear and cytoplasmic debris. Evaluation of
   the TM after SLT revealed no evidence of coagulative damage or
   disruption of the corneoscleral or uveal trabecular beam structure,
   Minimal evidence of mechanical damage was present after SLT, and the
   only ultrastructural evidence of laser tissue interaction was cracking
   of intracytoplasmic pigment granules and disruption of trabecular
   endothelial cells.
   Conclusions: SLT applied ``in vitro{''} to the TM of human eye bank eyes
   seemed to cause no coagulative damage and less structural damage to the
   human TM when compared with ALT and, therefore, may be a safer and more
   repeatable procedure. (C) 2001 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.}},

Abstract = {{We report results of hydrothermal experiments on four alluvial zircons
   from Sri Lanka, which cover a wide range of radiation damage, at 450
   degreesC and 1.3 kbar for 744 h with 2 M CaCl2 solution as reactive
   fluid. After the hydrothermal treatment, the most metamict samples show
   micrometer-thick reaction rims, which surround apparently unreacted
   zircon, as revealed by cathodoluminescence (CL) and Nomarski
   differential interference contrast (NDIC) images. These rims have sharp,
   curved, and transgressive boundaries with unreacted zircon and are, in
   some cases, spread out along cracks. The thickness of reaction rims
   increases with increasing cumulated cn-dosage of the starting materials.
   The reaction rims are strongly enriched in Ca (up to 7000 ppm) and a
   water species and depleted in radiogenic Pb, Zr, and Si, as revealed by
   electron microprobe analyses. A significant Th loss from the reaction
   rims was detected in the case of the most metamict sample, whereas U
   remained in the structure. FT-infrared spectrometry and X-ray
   diffraction measurements revealed that the bulk run products were
   recrystallized. Using micro-Raman spectrometry, we were able to
   demonstrate that differential recrystallization took place. The reaction
   rims are strongly recrystallized, whereas the unreacted grain interiors
   underwent only minor recrystallization. Recrystallization of the rims is
   accompanied by an enhancement of the integral CL intensity. It is
   suggested that recrystallization in the reaction rims was catalyzed by
   water infiltration and ion exchange and prevented significant congruent
   zircon dissolution under the given experimental conditions. Previous
   zircon studies have shown that (1) a transgressive morphology, (2) a
   reduced Th-U ratio, and (3) an enhanced CL emission are also
   characteristics of rims in zircons from high-grade metamorphic rocks.
   Based on these similarities between natural and experimentally produced
   rims, it is suggested that leaching-catalyzed recrystallization is an
   important alteration process in zircon under wet geological conditions
   and can account for many complex core-rim structures found in natural
   zircons. Furthermore, the strong enrichment of Ca in the reaction rims
   supports previous assumptions that high Ca concentrations in natural
   zircons are of secondary origin. It is suggested that lower U-Pb
   concordia intercept ages obtained from single-phase zircons with high Ca
   contents date a leaching event.}},

Abstract = {{The friction and wear characteristics of nanometer ZnO filled
   polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) composite blocks with different filler
   proportions in sliding against stainless steel rin g under dry friction
   condition were studied. The microstructures, worn surfaces and transfer
   films of PTFE and nanometer ZnO/PTFE composite were then examined with
   scanning electron microscope (SEM). Experimental results show that
   filling nanometer ZnO to PTFE could greatly reduce the wear of this
   polymer and the best anti-wear property was obtained with the composite
   containing 15 vol.\% nanometer ZnO. In comparison with pure PTFE, the
   friction property of these composites was maintained. With the increase
   of load and sliding velocity, the coefficient of friction of nanometer
   ZnO/PTFE composites was reduced and the anti-wear ability of them was
   not very damaged. It was seen from the cross-section micrographs of PTFE
   and nanometer ZnO/PTFE composite that the fiber structures that existed
   in pure PTFE were disappeaxed by filling nanometer ZnO into PTFE. This
   indicated that this filler could prevent the destruction of PTFE banded
   structures during friction process. SEM pictures of the transfer films
   indicated that with the frictional couple of stainless steel
   ring/composite block filled with 15 vol.\% nanometer ZnO, a uniform and
   tenacious transfer film was formed on the ring surface, which promised
   an excellent anti-wear property of this composite. SEM examination of 15
   vol.\% nanometer ZnO/PTFE composite also showed that some cracks on the
   worn surface of the composite appeared during sliding under 300 N. The
   creation and development of the cracks led to deterioration of the wear

   in viewing the damage in terms of an intrinsic problem rather than an

   to unify the damage process, three basic parameters are introduced for
   describing the overall fatigue process. These are DeltaK, K-max and
   internal stress contribution to K-max. In addition, there are other
   effects from environment and temperature that can contribute to these
   parameters. In particular K-max seems to play an important role in the
   overall damage process. We find that the internal stress is the missing
   link that can bridge the gap between the four main stages of damage that
   lies between the crack nucleation stage to final failure. Examples are
   sited in support of this view of explanation, Finally, it is suggested
   that systematic experimental data and analytical modeling to describe
   the internal stress gradients is required to help in forming a reliable
   life prediction methodology. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Brittle failure limits the compressive strength of rock and ice when
   rapidly loaded under low to moderate confinement. Higher confinement or
   slower loading results in ductile failure once the brittle-ductile
   transition is crossed. Brittle failure begins when primary cracks
   initiate and slide, creating wing cracks at their tips(1-3). Under
   little to no confinement, wing cracks extend and link together,
   splitting the material into slender columns which then fail. Under low
   to moderate confinement, wing crack growth is restricted and terminal
   failure is controlled by the localization of damage along a narrow band.
   Early investigations proposed that localization results from either the
   linkage of wing cracks(1-3) or the buckling of microcolumns created
   between adjacent wing cracks(4,5). Observations of compressive failure
   in ice(6) suggest a mechanism whereby localization initiates owing to
   the bending-induced failure of slender microcolumns created between sets
   of secondary cracks emanating from one side of a primary crack. Here we
   analyse this mechanism, and show that it leads to a closed-form,
   quantitative model that depends only on independently measurable
   mechanical parameters. Our model predictions for both the brittle
   compressive strength and the brittle-ductile transition are consistent
   with data from a variety of crystalline materials, offering quantitative
   evidence for universal processes in brittle failure and for the broad
   applicability of the model.}},

Abstract = {{Closed-form expressions for the thermo-elastic properties of
   {[}S/90(n)](s) laminates with transverse cracks in the 90 degrees layers
   are derived. Provided the normalised average crack-opening displacement
   (COD) is known, expressions contain only crack density, geometrical
   parameters and elastic constants of layers. The average COD dependence
   on the crack spacing and constraint effect of adjacent sub-laminates is
   analysed by using finite-element method in plane stress formulation. It
   is found that the out-of-plane elastic constants have an insignificant
   effect on GOD. A simple power law relating average COD to elastic and
   geometrical parameters of constituents is derived. The obtained power
   law and the developed methodology are successfully used to predict the
   reduction of thermo-elastic properties and damage evolution of {[}+/-
   theta /90(4)](s) laminates. The crack-closure technique and Monte-Carlo
   simulations are used to model the damage development. The 90 degrees
   layer is divided in to a large number of elements and G(c) values are
   assigned to each element according to a Weibull distribution. Parameters
   in the Weibull distribution are determined by using experimental crack
   density versus strain curve for glass-fibre/epoxy {[}0(2)/90(4)](s)
   cross-ply laminates. Damage development in {[}S/90(4)](s) laminates of
   the same material, containing sub-laminates with +/- theta layers only,
   is modelled by using these Weibull parameters and the results are in
   good agreement with test data. The effect of the thickness of the 90
   degrees layer on damage development is discussed in strength and

Abstract = {{This study investigated the fretting fatigue crack initiation behavior
   of titanium alloy, Ti-6Al-4V. Tests were conducted to generate fretting

   ability of two critical plane approaches to predict fretting fatigue
   crack initiation behavior; the Smith-Watson-Topper critical plane
   parameter and the maximum shear stress range critical plane parameter.
   When properly formulated, these parameters predicted number of cycles to
   crack initiation and location of crack initiation which were in
   agreement with the experimental counterparts. However, these two
   parameters predicted different orientation angles of crack initiation at

Abstract = {{A parametric study is conducted to quantify the effects of different

   typical plasma sprayed thermal barrier coating (PS-TBC) system. The
   study relies on the numerical results obtained from a continuum

   out-of-plane stress component which promotes the nucleation and growth
   of mesoscopic cracks within the top zirconia-based ceramic coating in
   terms of thermal cycle parameters, and accumulated oxidation time. Based
   on the results of the parametric study, a damage mechanics-based life
   prediction methodology for the failure of the PS-TBC under thermal
   fatigue loading conditions is proposed. The model assumes that PS-TBC
   failure occurs by a cleavage-type mechanism within the top zirconia
   coating, in agreement with experimental evidence, and that the
   accumulation of damage with thermal cycling is linked to the gradual
   degradation of the intrinsic cleavage strength of the zirconia. The

Abstract = {{The current study assesses the residual stresses and remnant damage
   caused by a spherical projectile impacting upon a flat surface. The
   immediate application of this information is to the problem of foreign
   object damage (FOD) associated with the ingestion of debris into an
   aircraft turbine engine and the subsequent reduction in component
   lifetime. The work is focused on two primary features: (i) the
   development of numerical models for the evaluation of the deformation
   and stresses associated with the impact process and (ii) the use of
   spatially resolved residual stress measurements to verify experimentally
   the numerical analysis. As a first approximation, a quasi-static
   numerical model was developed by ignoring time-dependent effects (i.e.,
   strain-rate sensitivity, wave and inertia effects, etc.), where the
   effects of velocity were approximated by adjusting the depth and
   diameter of the resulting impact crater to match that of actual impact
   craters at the corresponding velocity. The computed residual stresses
   and associated elastic strain gradients were compared to experimentally
   measured values, obtained using synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD)
   methods. This comparison indicated that the quasi-static numerical
   analysis was adequate for moderate impact conditions (velocity = 200
   m/s, energy = 2.7 J); however, under more aggressive conditions
   (velocity = 300 m/s, energy = 6.1 J), there was significant discrepancy
   between the numerical predictions and experimental measurements. Such
   discrepancy may be attributed to several factors that can occur at
   higher impact velocities, including strain-rate sensitivity, microcrack
   formation, and shear-band formation. A dynamic simulation, where the
   time-dependent effects of strain-rate sensitivity and elastic-wave
   interactions were approximated, provided results in closer agreement
   with the experimental diffraction observations. (C) 2001 Published by

Abstract = {{This paper presents a review of some recent experimental results and
   advances in the modelling and simulation of hydrogen induced damage in
   stress corrosion cracking (SCC). Experimental results are presented for
   different material/ solution systems. They outline the localised
   character of corrosion-deformation interactions that lead to SCC failure
   and the importance of a critical defect for localised hydrogen entry and
   damage, particularly in f.c.c. metals. Detailed observations of the
   fracture micro-crystallograph of 316L austenitic stainless steel single
   crystals in boiling MgCl2 are presented. They support the successive
   steps of the corrosion enhanced plasticity model, which is based on a
   local softening in the SCC crack region and on the repeated formation of
   a dislocation pile-up at some distance ahead of the crack. Critical
   experiments that highlight the nature of hydrogen-plasticity
   interactions in SCC also support this model. A simulation method for
   hydrogen-plasticity interactions is presented. It reproduces the
   decrease of the long-range interactions between dislocations in the
   presence of hydrogen. A general expression is given for such a decrease
   as a function of temperature, hydrogen concentration and material
   parameters. It is shown that solid solution hydrogen favours planar slip
   and the formation of dislocation pile-ups. The equilibrium configuration
   of a dislocation pile-up ahead of a SCC crack is studied and it is shown
   that diffusing hydrogen promotes stress concentrations against
   microstructural obstacles and periodic micro-fracture along the slip
   planes. Finally, the effect of hydrogen on a dislocation source at a
   crack tip is investigated. Hydrogen is shown to promote brittle fracture
   for particular orientations of f.c.c. single crystals. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In the past, weld-induced residual stresses caused damage to numerous
   (power) plant parts, components and systems (Erve, M., Wesseling, U.,
   Kilian, R., Hardt, R., Brummer, G., Maier, V., Ilg, U., 1994. Cracking
   in Stabilized Austenitic Stainless Steel Piping of German Boiling Water
   Reactors - Characteristic Features and Root Causes. 20. MPA-Seminar
   1994, vol. 2, paper 29, pp.29.1-29.21). In the case of BWR nuclear power
   plants, this damage can be caused by the mechanism of intergranular
   stress corrosion cracking in austenitic piping or the core shroud in the
   reactor pressure vessel and is triggered chiefly by weld-induced
   residual stresses. One solution of this problem that has been used in
   the past involves experimental measurements of residual stresses in
   conjunction with weld optimization testing. However? the experimental
   analysis of all relevant parameters is an extremely tedious process.
   Numerical simulation using the finite element method (FEM) not only
   supplements this method but, in view of modern computer capacities, is
   also an equally valid alternative in its own right. This paper will
   demonstrate that the technique developed for numerical simulation of the
   welding process has not only been properly verified and validated on
   austenitic pipe welds, but that it also permits making selective
   statements on improvements to the welding process. For instance,
   numerical simulation can provide information on the starting point of
   welding for every weld bead, the effect of interpass cooling as far as a
   possible sensitization of the heat affected zone (HAZ) is concerned, the
   effect of gap width on the resultant weld residual stresses? or the
   effect of the `last pass heat sink welding' (welding of the final passes
   while simultaneously cooling the inner surface with water) producing
   compressive stresses in the root area of a circumferential weld in an
   austenitic pipe. The computer program FERESA (finite element residual
   stress analysis) was based on a commercially available ABAQUS code
   (Hibbitt, Karlsson, Sorensen, Inc, 1997. ABAQUS user's manual, version
   5,6). and can be used as a 2-D or 3-D FEM analysis; depending on task
   definition it can provide a starting paint for a fracture mechanics
   safety analysis with acceptable computing times. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{An `elastio-plastic-cracking' (EPC) constitutive model was developed and
   incorporated into the commercial explicit finite element package ABAQUS
   to analyze the fracture characteristics of brittle materials subjected

   the development of lateral cracks during the unloading phase of the
   Vickers indentation cycle. The influence of material properties on
   induced damage zone characteristics was analyzed by defining a
   non-dimensional brittleness parameter. The model predictions of hardness
   as well as load-depth (P-h) relationship during an indentation cycle
   were found to agree well with the experimental trends presented

Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{The experimental information available in the literature regarding the
   patterns of breakage of agglomerate materials is scarce, particularly in
   dynamic loading. The primary objective of this paper is to present our
   findings on the break-age patterns of the agglomerates and the
   interparticle bond. A high-speed digital video imaging technique is used
   here to gain an insight into the impact behaviour of individual
   agglomerates against a target plate. Several breakage patterns are
   observed. Agglomerates may suffer localised damage only, with the
   disintegration of the damaged zone into very fine debris, or localised
   damage combined with fracture. The frequency of occurrence of these
   patterns depends on the impact velocity and agglomerate structure, The
   pattern of break-age affects significantly the size distribution of the
   impact product. An investigation of the breakage of individual
   interparticle bonds is also presented. Two forms of failure are
   observed, internal (cohesive) and interfacial (adhesive) failure. The
   morphology of the fractured surface depends greatly on the type of
   breakage. Internal breakage shows irregular surfaces due to crack
   jumping, whereas interfacial failure produces clean, smooth fracture
   surfaces. These observations should provide the necessary foundation for
   the development of a fundamental model of agglomerate breakage. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Understanding local microstructural deformations and strains in cortical
   bone may lead to a better understanding of cortical bone damage
   development, fracture, and remodeling. Traditional experimental
   techniques for measuring deformation and strain do not allow
   characterization of these quantities at the microstructural level in
   cortical bone. This study describes a technique based on digital
   stereoimaging used to measure the microstructural strain fields in
   cortical bone. The technique allows the measurement of material surface
   displacements and strains by comparing images acquired from a specimen
   at two distinct stress states. The accuracy of the system is
   investigated by analyzing an undeformed image set the test image is
   identical to the reference image but translated by a known pixel amount.
   An increase in the correlation sub-image train parameter results in an
   increase in displacement measurement accuracy from 0.049 to 0.012
   pixels. Errors in strain calculated from the measured displacement field
   were between 39 and 564 microstrain depending upon the sub-image train
   size and applied image displacement. The presence of a microcrack in
   cortical bone results in local strain at the crack tip reaching 0.030
   (30,000 microstrain) and 0.010 (10,000 microstrain) near osteocyte
   lacunae. It is expected that the use of this technique will allow a
   greater understanding of bone strength and fracture as well as bone
   mechanotransduction. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report on the fretting wear behaviour of polished and
   shot peened Ti-6Al-4V specimens. For fretting experiments, due to
   micro-displacements at the interface between two contacting surfaces,
   two types of damage can be observed: crack initiation and debris
   formation. Shot peening, which is already well known for improving
   fatigue resistance of titanium alloys, is shown to have a beneficial
   effect on the crack initiation and propagation under fretting wear
   loading, as cracks observed on specimens after cylinder-on-flat fretting
   tests are shorter in shot peened specimens than in polished ones. It is
   also demonstrated that shot peening decreases the friction coefficient
   only at the beginning of the test, as long as the asperities induced by
   shot peening are not worn-off. The effects of displacement amplitude,
   normal force and test duration on the wear volume have been
   investigated: in all cases, shot peening has no significant impact on
   the wear process. The same amount of debris are formed and ejected for
   both polished and shot peened specimens. Moreover, it is found that, for
   both types of specimens, the linear relation, developed for steels and
   hard coatings, between wear volume and cumulated dissipated energy is
   not valid in the present case as different wear volumes are measured for
   the same cumulated dissipated energy, depending on the experimental
   conditions (normal force, displacement amplitude). Using the test
   duration as the variable parameter, energy wear coefficients are
   calculated for different experimental conditions. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In cases of decorative and functional applications, chromium results in
   protection against wear and corrosion combined with chemical resistance
   and good lubricity. However, pressure to identify alternatives or to
   improve conventional chromium electroplating mechanical characteristics
   has increased in recent years, related to the reduction in the fatigue
   strength of the base material and to environmental requirements. The
   high efficiency and fluoride-free hard chromium electroplating is an
   improvement to the conventional process, considering chemical and
   physical final properties. One of the most interesting, environmentally
   safer and cleaner alternatives for the replacement of hard chrome
   plating is tungsten carbide thermal spray coating, applied by the high
   velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) process. The aim of this study was to analyse
   the effects of the tungsten carbide thermal spray coating applied by the
   HP/HVOF process and of the high efficiency and fluoride-free hard
   chromium electroplating (in the present paper called `accelerated'), in
   comparison to the conventional hard chromium electroplating on the AISI
   4340 high strength steel behaviour in fatigue, corrosion, and abrasive
   wear tests. The results showed that the coatings were damaging to the
   AISI 4340 steel behaviour when submitted to fatigue testing, with the
   tungsten carbide thermal spray coatings showing the better performance.
   Experimental data from abrasive wear tests were conclusive, indicating
   better results from the WC coating. Regarding corrosion by salt spray
   test, both coatings were completely corroded after 72 h exposure.
   Scanning electron microscopy technique (SEM) and optical microscopy were
   used to observe crack origin sites, thickness and adhesion in all the
   coatings and microcrack density in hard chromium electroplatings, to aid
   in the results analysis. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{P-wave velocities (V-p) and S-wave velocities (VS) and their directional
   dependence (velocity anisotropy, shear wave splitting) were measured on
   eight cores samples from the Kola superdeep well and on eight samples
   collected from surface outcrops over a range of pressures up to 600 MPa
   at room temperature and from room temperature up to 600 degreesC at 600
   MPa. The core samples were recovered at depths of about 4670 to 11,720
   m, and the outcrop samples represent lithologies similar to those of the
   core samples. Measurements were carried out on sample cubes of dry rocks
   (43 mm edge length) in a multianvil apparatus, allowing simultaneous
   measurements of Vp and Vs in the three structural directions X, Y, Z of
   the sample cubes and direct determination of length changes (volume
   change) of the sample with increasing pressure and temperature.
   Pronounced pressure (crack) sensitivity of P- and S-wave velocities
   indicates strong decompaction in the cores, due to drilling-induced
   damage and rapid pressure and temperature release during core retrieval.
   Marked velocity anisotropy and shear wave splitting is present in the
   foliated Proterozoic and Archean gneisses and amphibolites, due to
   oriented microcracks and lattice (crystallographic) preferred
   orientation (LPO) of the constituent mica and hornblende minerals. The
   experimentally determined intrinsic velocities and anisotropies compare
   fairly well with corresponding calculated data, based on the LPO and the
   single crystal properties of the major minerals. Measurements and
   calculations confirm strong relations of velocity anisotropy, shear wave
   splitting and shear wave polarisation to the structural frame of the
   rocks (foliation, lineation). The experimentally derived in situ
   velocities representing the averages of the velocities measured in the
   three structural directions (three P-wave and six S-wave velocities)
   compare fairly well with VSP data. The fit is even better when
   anisotropy (related to foliation and foliation dip) is included in the
   determination of the in situ velocities. From the relationship between
   experimental and calculated shear wave splitting data and the structural
   frame (foliation and lineation) of the Proterozoic and Archean rocks we
   interpret the VSP-derived shear wave polarisation at Kola (Digranes et
   al., 1996) as resulting from the strong alignment of mica and
   hornblende, defining the foliation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science BN. All

Abstract = {{This work is an in-depth study of a boundary effect detection (BED)
   method for pinpointing locations of small damages in beams using
   operational deflection shapes (ODSs) measured by a scanning laser
   vibrometer. The BED method requires no model or historical data for
   locating structural damage. It works by decomposing a measured ODS into
   central and boundary-layer solutions using a sliding-window
   least-squares curve-fitting technique. For high-order ODSs of an intact
   beam, boundary-layer solutions are non-zero only at structural
   boundaries. For a damaged beam, its boundary-layer solutions are
   non-zero at the original boundaries and damage locations because damage
   introduces new boundaries. At a damage location, the boundary-layer
   solution of slope changes sign, and the boundary-layer solution of
   displacement peaks up or dimples down. The theoretical background is
   shown in detail. Noise and different types of damage are simulated to
   show how they affect damage locating curves. Experiments are performed
   on several different beams with different types of damage, including
   surface slots, edge slots, surface holes, internal holes, and fatigue
   cracks. Experimental results show that this damage detection method is
   sensitive and reliable for locating small damages in beams. (C) 2001

   simulations using different damage models and experimental ones, showed
   that Gurson damage model is not able to predict the fracture propagation
   path in a realistic way. Only Lemaitre damage model gives good results.

Abstract = {{Wavelet transform of dynamic response data, experimentally acquired
   using a piezoelectric sensor, is presented as a local non-destructive
   evaluation technique for locating damage in a beam. The higher
   consistency and accuracy of the results based on data from a
   piezoelectric sensor over a conventional strain gauge are demonstrated.
   The allowable range of wavelet scale to process the data is shown to be
   dependent on the sampling rate, filter frequency and length of signal,
   where edge effects due to transformation must also be considered in the
   latter. By estimating the wave arrival times based on theoretical
   flexural wave velocity, the approximate wavelet scale to process the
   data can be determined. Further processing of the signal at a finer
   wavelet scale is necessary to improve the accuracy. Based on
   experimental data, the method is shown to be robust with respect to
   boundary and damage conditions as well as impact position.}},

Abstract = {{Films of GaN and ZnO can be separated from the substrates on which they
   are grown by the use of a laser-assisted debonding process in which a
   pulsed laser is shone through the substrate and absorbed in the film.
   Experience shows that the success in separating the films intact and
   damage free depends sensitively on the laser parameters used and the
   physical and geometric properties of the films. In this contribution,
   the mechanics of the laser-assisted debonding of GaN films are presented
   and used to construct process maps that delineate the conditions for
   damage-free film separation. The key variable is the nondimensional
   group OmegaE(p)/(d(p)(2)root tau), where Omega is a lumped material
   constant, E-p is the laser pulse energy, d(p) is the diameter of the
   illuminated area and tau is the laser pulse length. Experimental
   observations of UV/excimer laser assisted debonding of GaN films from
   sapphire substrates are used to illustrate the types of deformations and
   cracking modes on which the process maps are based. (C) 2001 American

Abstract = {{Photoelastic and shadowgraph imaging techniques were used to visualize
   the propagation and evolution of stress waves, and the resultant
   transient stress fields in solids during shock wave lithotripsy. In
   parallel, theoretical analysis of the wavefront evolution inside the
   solids was performed using a ray-tracing method. Excellent agreement
   between the theoretical prediction and experimental results was
   observed. Both the sample size and geometry were found to have a
   significant influence on the wave evolution and associated stress field
   produced inside the solid. In particular, characteristic patterns of
   spalling damage (i.e., transverse and longitudinal crack formation) were
   observed using plaster-of-Paris cylindrical phantoms of rectangular and
   circular cross sections. It was found that the leading tensile pulse of
   the reflected longitudinal wave is responsible for the initiation of
   microcracks in regions inside the phantom where high tensile stresses
   are produced. In addition, the transmitted shear wave was found to play
   a critical role in facilitating the extension and propagation of the
   microcrack. (C) 2001 Acoustical Society of America.}},

Abstract = {{At present, the compressive strength of composite laminates containing
   an open-hole can be predicted theoretically by using fracture mechanics
   based models such as the linear softening cohesive zone model. In this
   approach, the inelastic deformation associated with fibre microbuckling
   that develops near the hole edge is replaced with an equivalent crack
   loaded on its faces by a bridging traction which is linearly reduced
   with the crack closing displacement. By making use of this model, and by
   establishing an equivalent hole diameter from X-radiographs and/or
   ultrasonic C-scan images, the residual compressive strength after impact
   can be predicted. This paper outlines how the `equivalent hole' is
   determined and gives tabulated results of experimental and theoretical
   data. It is also shown that these data are in good agreement with each
   other for plain compression, open-hole compression and compression after
   impact strengths. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},
