Abstract = {{Cost-effective and reliable damage detection is critical for the
   utilization of composite materials. This paper presents part of an
   experimental and analytical survey of candidate methods for in situ
   damage detection of composite materials. Experimental results are
   presented for the application of Lamb wave techniques to quasi-isotropic
   graphite/epoxy test specimens containing representative damage modes,
   including delamination, transverse ply cracks and through-holes. Linear
   wave scans were performed on narrow laminated specimens and sandwich
   beams with various cores by monitoring the transmitted waves with
   piezoceramic sensors. Optimal actuator and sensor configurations were
   devised through experimentation, and various types of driving signal
   were explored. These experiments provided a procedure capable of easily
   and accurately determining the time of flight of a Lamb wave pulse
   between an actuator and sensor. Lamb wave techniques provide more
   information about damage presence and severity than previously tested
   methods (frequency response techniques), and provide the possibility of
   determining damage location due to their local response nature. These
   methods may prove suitable for structural health monitoring applications
   since the travel long distances and can be applied with conformable
   piezoelectric actuators and sensors that require little power.

Abstract = {{Piezoelectric wafer active sensors may be applied on aging aircraft
   structures to monitor the onset and progress of structural damage such
   as fatigue cracks and corrosion. The state of the art in
   piezoelectric-wafer active sensors structural health monitoring and
   damage detection is reviewed. Methods based on (a) elastic wave
   propagation and (b) the Electro-Mechanical (E/M) impedance technique are
   cited and briefly discussed. For health monitoring of aging aircraft
   structures, two main detection strategies are considered: the E/M
   impedance method for near field damage detection, and wave propagation
   methods for far-field damage detection. These methods are developed and
   verified on simple-geometry specimens and on realistic aging aircraft
   panels with seeded cracks and corrosion. The experimental methods,
   signal processing, and damage detection algorithms are tuned to the
   specific method used for structural interrogation. In the E/M impedance
   method approach, the high-frequency spectrum, representative of the
   structural resonances, is recorded. Then, overall-statistics damage
   metrics can be used to compare the impedance signatures and correlate
   the change in these signatures with the damage progression and
   intensity. In our experiments, the (1 - R-2)(3) damage metric was found
   to best fit the results in the 300-450 kHz band. In the wave propagation
   approach, the pulse-echo and acousto-ultrasonic methods can be utilized
   to identify the additional reflections generated from crack damage and
   the changes in transmission phase and velocity associated with corrosion
   damage. The paper ends with a conceptual design of a structural health
   monitoring system and suggestions for aging aircraft installation
   utilizing active-sensor arrays, data concentrators, wireless
   transmission, and a health monitoring and processing unit.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study of the confined compression behavior of concrete
   has been performed using 150 X 300 mm cylindrical specimens subjected to
   hydrostatic pressure in a triaxial cell and axial loading through a
   servo-hydraulic testing machine. A confining stress range of 0 to 60 MPa
   (about twice the uniaxial compressive strength) was employed to obtain
   the brittle-ductile transition behavior of the material. The increase in
   confining pressure leads to a change in the mode of failure and an
   increase in the maximum axial load-carrying capacity. It is seen that,
   at zero or low confinement, there is distributed microcracking and
   several macrocracks, and the response exhibits a well-defined peak and
   subsequent softening. At high confinements, relatively large axial and
   transversal strains of over 10\% have been obtained, with monotonically
   increasing loads leading to horizontal plateaus, There is no distributed
   cracking and failure occurs with the propagation of few macrocracks. In
   general, the observed trends confirm and extend previous results
   reported in the literature. Optical microscopy shows extensive
   microcracking, especially in the aggregates, and pore collapse at high
   confinement. A preliminary interpretation of the results based on the
   theory of elastoplasticity is also presented.}},

Abstract = {{The use of changes in dynamic system characteristics to detect damage
   has received considerable attention during the last years. This paper
   presents experimental results obtained within the framework of the
   development of a health monitoring system for civil engineering
   structures, based on the changes of dynamic characteristics. As a part
   of this research, reinforced concrete beams of 6 meters length are
   subjected to progressing cracking introduced in different steps. The
   damaged sections are located in symmetrical or asymmetrical positions
   according to the beam tested. The damage assessment consists in relating
   the changes observed in the dynamic characteristics and the level of the
   crack damage introduced in the beams.
   It appears from this analysis that eigenfrequencies are affected by
   accumulation of cracks in the beams and that their evolutions are not
   influenced by the crack damage locations; they decrease with the crack
   damage accumulation. The MAC factors are less sensitive to crack damage
   compared to eigenfrequencies, but give an indication of the symmetrical
   or asymmetrical nature of the induced crack damage. Next to this, the
   COMAC factors, the strain energy evolution and the changes in
   flexibility matrices are also examined as to their capability for
   detection and location of damage in the RC beams, the strain energy
   method appears to be more precise than the others. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A mechanistic model of impact attrition of particulate solids, having a

   mechanics is used to analyse the propagation of these cracks in order to
   provide a base to estimate the rate of attrition. A dimensionless

   impact conditions. It has the form:

   a characteristic particle size, H is the hardness and K-c is the

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method for estimating high-cycle fatigue strength
   under multiaxial loading conditions. The physical interpretation of the
   fatigue damage is based on the theory of cyclic deformation in single
   crystals. Such a theory is also used to single out those stress
   components which can be considered significant for crack nucleation and
   growth in the so-called Stage I regime. Fatigue life estimates are
   carried out by means of a modified Wohler curve which can be applied to
   both smooth and blunt notched components, subjected to either in-phase
   or out-of-phase loads. The modified Wohler curve plots the fatigue
   strength in terms of the maximum macroscopic shear stress amplitudes,
   the reference plane - where such amplitudes have to be evaluated - being
   thought of as coincident with the fatigue microcrack initiation plane.
   The position of the fatigue strength curve also depends on the stress
   component normal to such a plane and the phase angle as well. About 450
   experimental data taken from the literature are used to check the
   accuracy of the method under multiaxial fatigue conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Guided Lamb waves can be used for a fast inspection of large areas, e.g.
   the detection of cracks at rivet holes in the fuselage of airplanes.
   When the guided wave hits a discontinuity like a hole, a typical
   scattered displacement field is obtained. A change of the scattered
   field indicates the development of a crack. In the experiments, the
   first anti-symmetric mode A(0) of Lamb waves in plates is excited
   selectively by means of a piezoelectric transducer. The used frequency
   range is below the cut-off frequencies of higher wave modes. The
   scattered field around undamaged and damaged holes is measured on a grid
   around the hole with a heterodyne laser interferometer. Two types of
   damage are introduced: a notch cut with a very fine saw blade, and a
   fatigue grown crack. A significant change in the scattered field due to
   the defect is seen. Good agreement of the experimental results with
   theoretical calculations is obtained, The wave propagation is studied
   using Mindlin's theory of plates. The scattered field is calculated
   analytically and using finite difference methods (FDMs). (C) 2002

Abstract = {{A mesh-free Galerkin simulation of dynamic shear band propagation in an
   impact-loaded pre-notched plate is carried out in both two and three
   dimensions. The related experimental work was initially reported by
   Kalthoff and Winkler (1987), and later re-examined by Zhou et al.
   (1996a,b), and others.
   The main contributions of this numerical simulation are as follows: (1)
   The ductile-to-brittle failure mode transition is observed in numerical
   simulations for the first time; (2) the experimentally observed dynamic
   shear band, whose character changes with an increase of impact velocity,
   propagating along curved paths is replicated; (3) the simulation is able
   to capture the details of the adiabatic shear band to a point where the
   periodic temperature profile inside shear band at mum scale can clearly
   be seen; (4) an intense, high strain rate region is observed in front of
   the shear band tip, which, we believe, is caused by wave trapping at the
   shear band tip; it in turn causes damage and stress collapse inside the
   shear band and provides a key link for self-sustained instability. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper, strong discontinuities embedded in finite elements are
   used to model discrete cracking in quasi-brittle materials. Special
   attention is paid to (i) the constitutive models used to describe the
   localized behaviour of the discontinuities, (ii) the enforcement of the
   continuity of the crack path and (iii) mixed-mode crack propagation.
   Different constitutive relations are adopted to describe the localized
   behaviour of the discontinuities, namely two damage laws and one
   plasticity law. A numerical algorithm is introduced to enforce the
   continuity of the crack path. In the examples studied, an objective
   dissipation of energy with respect to the mesh is found. Examples of
   mode-I and mixed-mode crack propagation are presented, namely a double
   notch tensile test and a single-edge notched beam subjected to shear. In
   the former case different crack patterns are obtained depending on the
   notch offset, in the latter case special emphasis is given to the effect
   of shear on the global structural response. In particular, both the peak
   load and the softening response of the structure are related to the
   amount of shear tractions allowed to develop between crack faces. The
   results obtained are compared to experimental results. As a general
   conclusion, it is found that crack path continuity allows for the
   development of crack patterns similar to those found in experiments,
   even when reasonably coarse meshes are used. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{An orthotropic damage model specifically developed for the analysis of
   brittle masonry subjected to in-plane loading is described. Four
   independent internal damage parameters, one in compression and one in
   tension for each of the two natural axes of the masonry, are defined
   allowing the stiffness recovery at crack closure as well as the
   different inelastic behaviour along each natural axis to be considered.
   The damage field of the material is defined in terms of four equivalent
   stresses and results, in the space of the in-plane effective stresses,
   in a double pyramid with a rectangular base where the slopes of the
   faces correspond to the internal friction angle of the material. The
   equivalent stresses also control the growth of the damage parameters.
   The returning path from the effective to the damaged stresses is given
   by multiplication by a fourth-rank damage effect tensor, which is a
   function of the damage parameters and of the effective stress state.
   Mesh size regularization is achieved by means of an enhanced local
   method taking into account the finite element size. Good agreement has
   been found in the comparison between numerical results and experimental

Abstract = {{In order to optimize the blanking processes, it is important to identify
   the conditions within the deforming workpiece which may lead to fracture
   initiation and propagation. Within this framework, numerical simulations
   are widely used in industries to optimize sheet metal forming processes.
   However, in order to have a confidence in the results of such
   simulations, an accurate material model is required. The accuracy of a
   material model is affected by the constitutive equations and the values
   of the material parameters. In order to reduce the danger of fracture of
   metal parts during manufacturing processes, advanced optimal design
   requires knowledge of critical values of some fracture criteria of the
   material used. Experimental identification of fracture criteria are
   currently obtained by performing several complicated tests and long
   duration of experiments.
   This study presents a computation methodology allowing for the
   identification of critical values of fracture criteria in order to
   simulate crack initiation and propagation generated by shearing
   mechanisms, which are needed for metal blanking processes simulation.
   The approach is based on inverse technique using circular blanking
   experiments and finite element calibration model. The critical values of
   fracture criteria are obtained in such a way that the finite element
   force-penetration predicted curve fit the experimental plot deduced from
   blanking tests. The numerical results obtained by the simulation were
   compared with experimental ones to verify the validity of the proposed
   technique for fracture criteria identification. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Elastomeric matrix composites are usually reinforced by mineral
   particles such as carbon black and sometimes by long metallic or organic
   fibers. In the absence of Fiber, rubbers can be considered as
   nanocomposites. In service conditions, the fatigue damage of rubbers is
   a combination of: (a) mechanical damage; (b) chemical damage; (c)
   thermal damage. Experience shows that, in cyclic loading, rubbers are
   damaged to the point of formation of one or several cracks which then
   propagate. As for metal, it is recommended to study separately
   initiation of cracks and then their propagation. Generally speaking, the
   fatigue resistance is affected by chemical transformation such as
   crystallisation. It means that compression loading is an important
   factor. To show this effect, an axisymetric hour-glass shape specimen
   (D=25 mm) is proposed to test rubbers. A large effect has been found of
   the mean stress on the fatigue strength depending on the chemical
   composition of the materials and of crystallisation transformation if it
   appears. The crack growth rate is studied using linear fracture
   mechanics as proposed earlier (Rivlin RS, Thomas AG. Rupture of rubber:
   I. Characteristic energy for tearing. J Polymer Sci 1953;10(3):291). In
   this case, the strain energy release rate G is substituted for the
   concept of tearing energy T. The application of fracture mechanics to
   elastomers generates some difficulties because of the important
   deformability. In order to apply a tens ion-compression loading a thick
   edge notched specimen is recommended with two lateral grooves (W=150 mm,
   B=25 mm). For low values of DeltaT, a threshold can de defined depending
   on the R ratio. It is shown that for a high R ratio the fatigue crack
   would not propagate if the crystallisation transformation is high. In
   contrast, if R=-1, the threshold disappears. A finite element simulation
   of stresses and strains is presented in order to get a better
   explanation of the experimental results. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Delamination initiation and growth are analyzed by using a discrete
   cohesive crack model. The delamination is constrained to grow along a

   dependent on the amount of dissipated crack opening work, such that the
   maximum load surface shrinks to zero as a predefined amount of work is
   consumed. A damage formulation is used to reduce the adhesive forces.
   Mode I, II and III loading or any combined loading is possible. An
   analytical solution is obtained for a single mode opening and the
   implications of this result on the governing equations is discussed. The

Abstract = {{Statistics show that fatigue crack development comes first and foremost
   as a damage source in aerospace metallic structures. Currently,
   widespread methods are available to inspect these structures, but they
   are quite time-consuming, costly and require the structural system to be
   idle. Next, attempts to develop damage detection integrated systems are
   paramount for the safety and cost of such structures. This paper
   describes an investigation into the feasibility of using an integrated
   system based on Lamb waves in order to assess the integrity of riveted
   aluminium, joints during cyclical loading. In this experimental
   analysis, Lamb waves are excited and received outside the joint area
   using piezoelectric transducers coupled onto the plates. The detected
   damage is cracks in joint resulting from fatigue loading. The collected
   signals on the piezoelectric transducers are analysed using Hilbert
   transform and time-frequency analysis. It is shown that the final
   interpretation of Lamb wave analysis may provide a means of sizing the
   defects and following the crack development. In addition to that, an
   acoustic emission system is used jointly with the Lamb wave analysis in
   order to discuss results and damage development. Finally, it is
   demonstrated that both methods can work together and the results
   obtained are in good agreement. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Reported nearly a decade ago, cyclic fatigue failure in silicon thin
   films has remained a mystery. Silicon does not display the
   room-temperature plasticity or extrinsic toughening mechanisms necessary
   to cause fatigue in either ductile (e.g., metals) or brittle (e.g.,
   ceramics and ordered intermetallics) materials. This letter presents
   experimental evidence for the cyclic fatigue of silicon via a
   conceptually different mechanism termed reaction-layer fatigue. Based on
   mechanical testing, electron microscopy, and self-assembled monolayers,
   we present direct observation of fatigue-crack initiation in
   polycrystalline silicon, the mechanism of crack initiation, and a method

Abstract = {{Residual stress due to shrinkage of polymethylmethacrylate bone cement
   after polymerisation is possibly one factor capable of initiating cracks
   in the mantle of cemented hip replacements. No relationship between
   residual stress and observed cracking of cement has yet been
   demonstrated. To investigate if any relationship exists, a physical
   model has been developed which allows direct observation of damage in
   the cement layer on the femoral side of total hip replacement. The model
   contains medial and lateral cement layers between a bony surface and a
   metal stem; the tubular nature of the cement mantle is ignored. Five
   specimens were prepared and examined for cracking using manual tracing
   of stained cracks, observed by transmission microscopy: cracks were
   located and measured using image analysis. A mathematical approach for
   the prediction of residual stress due to shrinkage was developed which
   uses the thermal history of the material to predict when stress-locking
   occurs, and estimates subsequent thermal stress. The residual stress
   distribution of the cement layer in the physical model was then
   calculated using finite element analysis. Results show maximum tensile
   stresses normal to the observed crack directions, suggesting a link
   between residual stress and preload cracking. The residual stress
   predicted depends strongly on the definition of the reference
   temperature for stress-locking. The highest residual stresses (4-7 MPa)
   are predicted for shrinkage from maximum temperature, in this case,
   magnitudes are sufficiently high to initiate cracks when the influence
   of stress raisers such as pores or interdigitation at the bone/cement
   interface are taken into account (up to 24 MPa when calculating stress
   around a pore according to the method of Harrigan and Harris (J.
   Biomech. 24(11) (1991) 1047-1058)). We conclude that the damage
   accumulation failure scenario begins before weight-bearing due to
   cracking induced by residual stress around pores or stress raisers. (C)

   damage indices related to the curvature mode shape (CMS) and the strain

   existing results, the effects of the numbers of the selected modes and
   defective areas on the CMS index and the influence of the ``natural

Abstract = {{A numerical model for simulating the process of low-velocity impact
   damage in composite laminates using the finite element method is
   presented in this paper, i.e. Part I of this two part series on the
   study of impact. In this model, the 9-node Lagrangian element of the
   Mindlin plate with consideration of large deformation analysis is
   employed. To analyze the transient response of the laminated plates, a
   modified Newmark time integration algorithm previously proposed by the
   authors is adopted here. We also proved that the impact process between
   a rigid ball and laminated plates is a stiff system, therefore a kind of
   A(a) stable method has been advocated here to solve the motion equation
   of the rigid ball. Furthermore, various types of damages including
   delamination, matrix cracking and fiber breakage, etc. and their mutual
   influences are modeled and investigated in detail. To overcome the
   difficulty of numerical oscillation or instability in the analysis of
   the dynamic contact problem between delaminated layers using the
   traditional penalty methods, we have employed dynamic spring constraints
   to simulate the contact effect, which are added to the numerical model
   by a kind of continuous penalty function. Moreover, an effective
   technique to calculate the strain energy release rate based on the
   Mindlin plate model is proposed, which can attain high precision.
   Finally, some techniques of adaptive analyses have been realized for
   improving the computational efficiency. Based on this model, a program
   has been developed for numerically simulating the damage process of
   cross-ply fiber-reinforced carbon/epoxy composite laminates under
   low-velocity impact load. In Part II, this numerical model will be
   verified by comparing with the experimental results. Also the impact
   damage will be investigated in detail using this numerical approach. (C)

Abstract = {{The numerical simulation of the damage and fracture processes of
   concrete structures has evolved considerably in the past years. In this
   contribution, a newly proposed mechanical model is used to simulate the
   fracture behavior of double-edge notched (DEN) and double central
   notched (DCN) concrete specimens loaded in shear. In this numerical
   model, the concrete is assumed to be a three-phase composite composed of
   matrices, aggregates and rnatrix-aggregate interfaces. An elastic finite
   element program is employed as the basic stress analysis tool while the
   elastic damage mechanics is used to describe the constitutive law of
   meso-level element. The maximum tensile strain criterion and
   Mohr-Coulomb criterion are utilized as damage thresholds. The
   heterogeneous stress field is obtained from numerical simulation, thus
   it is found that heterogeneity of mechanical properties has significant
   effect on the stress distribution in concrete. The crack propagation
   processes simulated with this model shows good agreement with those of
   experimental observations. It has been found that the shear fracture of
   concrete observed at the macroscopic level is predominantly caused by
   tensile damage at the mesoscopic level. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The influence of a transverse open crack on the mechanical impedance of
   cracked beams under various boundary conditions is investigated both
   analytically and experimentally. It is shown that the driving-point

   changes depend on the location and the size of the crack and on the
   force location. Monitoring the change of the first antiresonance as a
   function of the measuring location along the beam, a jump in the slope
   of the plot in the vicinity of the crack occurs. The magnitude of the
   jump depends on the crack size. Experimental results are presented from
   tests on Plexiglas beams damaged at different locations and different
   magnitudes and are found to be in good agreement with theoretical
   predictions. Based on the results of the present work, an efficient

Abstract = {{By a laser-induced backside wet etching method using a pyrene/acetone
   solution, a fused silica plate was etched upon irradiation with a
   conventional XeCl excimer laser. The etch rate was about 50\% lower than
   that obtained with a KrF excimer laser under the same experimental
   conditions. The threshold fluence for etching was estimated to be below
   0.5 J cm(-2) and a typical etch rate was around 10 nm pulse(-1) at a
   fluence of 1 J cm(-2). After producing the sample having the 10 mum
   lines and space by irradiation with the first 200 pulses, the second 400
   pulses were irradiated to the target sample rotated at right angle. As a
   result, a square dotted pattern was given without damages for the first
   etched pattern. Micrographs of the etched surfaces show that this
   process is a remarkably gentle process free from crack and debris, and
   favorable for microcrack-free etching of transparent materials. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{In order to resolve problems concerning the understanding and the
   control of laser-induced damage of silica optical elements, a
   collaboration between the CEA and different university laboratories has
   been undertaken. Ultra-pure silica model samples, seeded with gold
   nanoparticles whose diameter did not exceed 5 nm, were prepared. The aim
   in using these samples was to observe the mechanism of damage initiation
   that could be attributed to inclusions of nanometric size. This paper
   presents the different steps encountered during this study: preparation
   of the samples, the laser-induced damage tests, the Nomarski and
   atomic-force microscope observations of this damage and a series of
   experiments using a time-of-flight mass spectrometer at Argonne National
   Laboratory. The experimental data are then interpreted, and, in
   particular, compared to numerical simulations. A very encouraging result
   is the existence of a pre-damage phase at very low fluences that is not
   detectable by classical optical devices. The experimental means
   developed for such model samples should be transposable to the analysis
   of industrial glasses.}},

Abstract = {{Damage growth in optical materials used in large-aperture laser systems
   is an issue of great importance to determine component lifetime and
   therefore cost of operation. Small size damage sites tend to grow when
   exposed to subsequent high-power laser irradiation at 355 nm. An
   understanding of the photo-physical processes associated with damage
   growth is important to devise mitigation techniques. We examine the role
   of laser-modified material and cracks formed in the crater of damage
   pits in the damage growth process using fused-silica and deuterated KDP
   samples. Experimental results indicate that both of the above-mentioned
   features can initiate plasma formation at fluences as low as 2 J/cm(2).
   The intensity of the recorded plasma emission remains low for fluences
   up to approximately 5 J/cm(2) but rapidly increases thereafter,
   accompanied by an increase of the size of the damage crater. (C) 2002
