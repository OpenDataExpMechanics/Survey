Abstract = {{A new decohesion element with the capability of dealing with crack
   propagation under mixed-mode loading is proposed and demonstrated. The
   element is used at the interface between solid finite elements to model
   the initiation and non-self-similar growth of delaminations in composite
   materials. A single relative displacement-based damage parameter is
   applied in a softening law to track the damage state of the interface
   and to prevent the restoration of the cohesive state during unloading.
   The softening law is applied in the three-parameter Benzeggagh-Kenane
   mode interaction criterion to predict mixed-mode delamination
   propagation. To demonstrate the accuracy of the predictions,
   steady-state delamination growth is simulated for quasi-static loading
   of various single mode and mixed-mode delamination test specimens and

Abstract = {{In recent years, significant efforts have been devoted to developing
   non-destructive techniques for damage identification in structures. The
   work reported in this paper is part of an ongoing research on the
   experimental investigations of the effects of cracks and damages on the
   integrity of structures, with a view to detect, quantify, and determine
   their extents and locations. Two sets of aluminum beams were used for
   this experimental study. Each set consisted of seven beams, the first
   set had fixed ends, and the second set was simply supported. Cracks were
   initiated at seven different locations from one end to the other end
   (along the length of the beam) for each set, with crack depth ratios
   ranging from 0.1d to 0.7d (d is the beam depth) in steps of 0.1, at each
   crack location. Measurements of the acceleration frequency responses at
   seven different points on each beam model were taken using a dual
   channel frequency analyzer.
   The damage detection schemes used in this study depended on the measured
   changes in the first three natural frequencies and the corresponding
   amplitudes of the measured acceleration frequency response functions.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study of the relationship between EDM parameters
   and surface cracks by using a full factorial design, based upon
   discharge current and pulse-on time parameters. The study analyzes the
   EDM machining of D2 and H13 tool steels as materials. The formation of
   surface cracks is explored by considering surface roughness, white layer
   thickness, and the stress induced by the EDM process. When the pulse
   voltage is maintained at a constant value of 120 V, it is possible to
   avoid the formation of cracks if machining is carried out with a pulse
   current in the range of 12-16 A together with a pulse-on duration of 6-9
   mus. Based upon the experimental results, this study establishes a crack
   prediction map, and indicates whether or not cracks are likely to form
   for a given pulse-on and pulse current combination. Its use will provide
   a valuable aid in improving the quality of the EDM process. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{In this contribution various aspects of an anisotropic damage model
   coupled to plasticity are considered. The model is formulated within the
   thermodynamic framework and implements a strong coupling between
   plasticity and damage. The constitutive equations for the damaged
   material are written according to the principle of strain energy
   equivalence between the virgin material and the damaged material. The
   damaged material is modeled using the constitutive laws of the effective
   undamaged material in which the nominal stresses are replaced by the
   effective stresses. The model considers different interaction mechanisms
   between damage and plasticity defects in such a way that two-isotropic
   and two-kinematic hardening evolution equations are derived, one of each
   for the plasticity and the other for the damage. An additive
   decomposition of the total strain into elastic and inelastic parts is
   adopted in this work. The elastic part is further decomposed into two
   portions, one is due to the elastic distortion of the material grains
   and the other is due to the crack closure and void contraction. The
   inelastic part is also decomposed into two portions, one is due to
   nucleation and propagation of dislocations and the other is due to the
   lack of crack closure and void contraction. Uniaxial tension tests with
   unloadings have been used to investigate the damage growth in high
   strength steel. A good agreement between the experimental results and
   the model is obtained. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Numerical aspects of the grain level micromechanical model presented in
   part I are discussed in this study. They include, an examination of
   solution convergence in the context of cohesive elements used as an
   approach to model crack initiation and propagation; performance of
   parametric studies to assess the role of grain boundary strength and
   toughness, and their stochasticity, on damage initiation and evolution.
   Simulations of wave propagation experiments, performed on alumina, are
   used to illustrate the capabilities of the model in the framework of
   experimental measurements. The solution convergence studies show that
   when the length of the cohesive elements is smaller than the cohesive
   zone size and when the initial slope of the traction-separation cohesive
   law is properly chosen, the predictions concerning microcrack initiation
   and evolution are mesh independent. Other features examined in the
   simulations were the effect of initial stresses and defects resulting
   from the material manufacturing process, Also described are conditions
   on the selection of the representative volume element size, as a
   function of ceramic properties. to capture the proper distance between
   crack initiation sites. Crack branching is predicted in the case of
   strong ceramics and sufficient distance between nucleation sites. Rate
   effects in the extension of microcracks were studied in the context of
   damage kinetics and fragmentation patterns. The simulations show that
   crack speed can be significantly varied in the presence of rate effects

   achieved, This paper illustrates the utilization of grain level models

Abstract = {{Synchrotron X-ray microtomography has been utilized for the in-situ
   observation of steady-state plane-strain fatigue crack growth. A
   high-resolution experimental configuration and phase contrast imaging
   technique have enabled the reconstruction of crack images with an
   isotropic voxel with a 0.7 mum edge. The details of a crack are readily
   observed, together with evidence of the incidence and mechanical
   influence of closure. After preliminary investigations of the achievable
   accuracy and reproducibility, a variety of measurement methods are used
   to quantify crack-opening displacement (COD) and closure from the
   tomography data. Utilization of the physical displacements of
   microstructural features is proposed to obtain detailed COD data, and
   its feasibility is confirmed. Loss of fracture surface contact occurs
   gradually up to the maximum load. This is significantly different from
   tendencies reported where a single definable opening level is
   essentially assumed to exist. The closure behaviour is found to be
   attributable mainly to pronounced generation of mode III displacement
   which may be caused by local crack topology. Many small points of
   closure still remain near the crack tip, suggesting that the near-tip
   contact induces crack growth resistance. The effects of overloading are
   also discussed.}},

   model. A damage-based approach is used to predict the crack propagation
   rate in a compact tension specimen and the data are correlated against
   an independently determined C{*} parameter. Elastic-creep and
   elastic-plastic-creep analyses are performed using two different crack
   growth criteria to predict crack extension under plane stress and plane
   strain conditions. The plane strain crack growth rate predicted from the
   numerical analysis is found to be less conservative than the plane
   strain upper bound of an existing ductility exhaustion model, for values
   of C{*} within the limits of the present CCG testing standards. At low
   values of C{*} the predicted plane stress and plane strain crack growth
   rates differ by a factor between 5 and 30 depending on the creep
   ductility of the material. However, at higher loads and C{*} values, the
   plane strain crack growth rates, predicted using an
   elastic-plastic-creep material response, approach those for plane
   stress. These results are consistent with experimental data for the
   material and suggest that purely elastic-creep modelling is unrealistic
   for the carbon-manganese steel as plastic strains are significant at
   relevant loading levels. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental studies have been performed of foreign object damage (FOD)
   imparted to a thermal barrier system under conditions representative of
   those found in a turbine engine. The sub-surface damage has been
   characterized by using the focused ion beam (FIB) imaging system. The
   characterization reveals changes in the thermal barrier coating (TBC),
   caused by particle impact. that confirm and elaborate previous
   observations of FOD. These features include a permanent impression, a
   zone of densification, shear bands penetrating from the impact site to
   the interface with the bond coat, and delamination cracks extending away
   from the impact in the TBC adjacent to the interface. The dimensions of
   these features have been reported. A simulation procedure has been
   devised and implemented. The simulations have been performed in
   conjunction with a new non-dimensional analysis that allows the impact
   and material variables to be grouped into the smallest possible
   parameter set needed to characterize the stresses and projectile
   velocities, as well as the impression and densification zone dimensions.
   This parameterization provides explicit results for the stresses and
   displacements that arise as the projectile characteristics and material
   properties are varied over a range applicable to FOD in gas turbines. A
   scaling relation has been derived from the stress field and the
   penetration that relates the length of the interface delamination to the
   impact and material variables. A comparison of the simulations with the
   measurements indicates that the unknown impact velocity of the
   projectile can be ascertained from the penetration depth if the yield
   strength is known and vice versa. With this information, the scaling
   relation for the size of the interface delamination indicates
   consistency with the measured cracks. The implication is that
   delamination can be suppressed by lowering the high temperature hardness
   of the TBC and by increasing its toughness. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A comparative study of the mechanical properties of 20 experimental
   alloys has been carried out. The effect of different contents of Si, Cu,
   Mg, Fe and Mn, as well as solidification rate, has been assessed using a
   strength-ductility chart and a quality index-strength chart developed
   for the alloys.
   The charts show that the strength generally increases and the ductility
   decreases with an increasing content of Cu and Mg. Increased Fe (at
   Fe/Mn ratio 0.5) dramatically lowers the ductility and strength of low
   Si alloys. Increased Si content generally increases the strength and the
   ductility. The increase in ductility with increased Si is particularly
   significant when the Fe content is high. The charts are used to show
   that the cracking of second phase particles imposes a limit to the
   maximum achievable strength by limiting the ductility of strong alloys.
   The (Cu + Mg) content (at.\%), which determines the precipitation
   strengthening and the volume fraction of Cu-rich and Mg-rich
   intermetallics, can be used to select the alloys for given strength and
   ductility, provided the Fe content stays below the Si-dependent critical

Abstract = {{The weight function method is described to analyze the crack growth
   behavior in functionally graded materials and in particular materials
   with a rising crack growth resistance curve. Further, failure of graded
   thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) under cyclic surface heating by laser
   irradiation is modeled on the basis of fracture mechanics. The damage of
   both graded and non-graded TBCs is found to develop in several distinct
   stages: vertical cracking --> delamination --> blistering --> spalling.
   This sequence can be understood as an effect of progressive shrinkage
   due to sintering and high-temperature creep during thermal cycling,
   which increases the energy-release rate for vertical cracks which
   subsequently turn into delamination cracks. The results of finite
   element modeling, taking into account the TBC damage mechanisms, are
   compatible with experimental data. An increase of interface fracture
   toughness due to grading and a decrease due to ageing have been measured
   in a four-point bending test modified by a stiffening layer. Correlation
   with the damage observed in cyclic heating is discussed. It is explained
   in which way grading is able to reduce the damage. (C) 2003 Published by

Abstract = {{This paper presents a detailed numerical study of the mode I
   interlaminar fracture of carbon/epoxy composite laminates with z-fibre
   reinforcement. The study was performed using a double cantilever beam
   configuration. A finite element model was developed using thick-layered
   shell elements to model the composite laminates and non-linear interface
   elements to simulate the through thickness reinforcements. An existing
   micro-mechanical solution was employed to model the material behaviour
   of the interface element. The numerical analysis showed that z-fibre
   pinning were effective in bridging delamination when damage had
   propagated into the z-fibre field; these pins provided crack closure
   forces that shielded the delamination crack from the full delaminating
   force and moment due to applied loads. Therefore, the z-fibre technique
   significantly improves the crack growth resistance and hence arrests or
   delays delamination extension. The numerical results were validated
   against experimental data. With reference to structural integrity this
   technique can be used to design a more damage tolerant structure. (C)

Abstract = {{Delamination, a typical mode of interfacial damage in laminated
   composites, has been considered in the context of continuum damage
   mechanics in this paper. Interfaces where delaminations could occur are
   introduced between the constituent layers. A simple but appropriate
   continuum damage representation is proposed. A single scalar damage
   parameter is employed and the degradation of the interface stiffness is
   established. Use has been made of the concept of a damage surface to
   derive the damage evolution law. The damage surface is constructed so
   that it combines the conventional stress-based and
   fracture-mechanics-based failure criteria which take account of mode
   interaction in mixed-mode delamination problems. The damage surface
   shrinks as damage develops and leads to a softening interfacial
   constitutive law. By adjusting the shrinkage rate of the damage surface,
   various interfacial constitutive laws found in the literature can be
   reproduced. An incremental interfacial constitutive law is also derived
   for use in damage analysis of laminated composites, which is a
   non-linear problem in nature. Numerical predictions for problems
   involving a DCB specimen under pure mode I delamination and mixed-mode
   delamination in a split beam are in good agreement with available
   experimental data or analytical solutions. The model has also been
   applied to the prediction of the failure strength of overlap
   ply-blocking specimens. The results have been compared with available
   experimental and alternative theoretical ones and discussed fully. (C)

Abstract = {{Non-destructive evaluation appears more and more important in the civil
   engineering economic stakes, In this context electrical resistivity
   measurements get sensitivity to parameters allowing to assess concrete
   structures conditions. This article analyses the ability of the
   resistivity measurement to study cracks in concrete. Its ability to
   detect and to locate cracks and spalling is shown with on site
   measurements on a damaged slab. Then specific studies on such disorders
   allow to distinguish the influence of their characteristics.
   The sensitivity of the method to cracks depth, according their moisture
   conditions, is assessed by computation. Experimental works on a
   reinforced concrete beam, ideally cracked, confirmed these results.
   Some assumptions based on measurements realised on a size-one structural
   component allow to assess the general influence of crack opening and
   bridging degree between crack lips.
   Qualitative results show the similar effects on measurement of various
   cracking parameters. Prospective works presented in the paper lead us to
   say that electrical resistivity method applied to civil engineering
   structures is a relevant tool for the assessment of structural damage.

Abstract = {{This paper studies the influence of type of steel on electrical
   discharge machined (EDM) surface integrity. Tests were performed with
   two hardenable steels (tool steel type X155CrMoV12 and high carbon
   content steel type C90) and two non-hardenable steels (austenitic
   stainless steel type X2CrNiMo17-12-02 and ferritic stainless steel type
   X6Cr17). Surface integrity was characterized by roughness,
   micro-hardness, residual stress distribution and near surface damage.
   In the case of hardenable steels, EDM leads to a structure of three
   layers, white, martensite quenched and transition layers. High carbon
   diffusion induces important near surface hardening and a high tensile
   residual stress level that leading to crack generation.
   In the case of non-hardenable steels, metallurgical transformations
   result only on the formation of the recast layer with a dendritic
   structure and a slight increase in grain size. Near surface hardening
   due to carbon enrichment depends strongly on the initial structure (BCC
   or FCC).
   Finite element method has been used to assess temperature and residual
   stress fields in the case of X2CrNiMo17-12-02 steel. Experimental and
   calculated residual stress profiles were compared. It was found that the
   shapes of the profiles are different in the surface layers and quite
   similar in the deeper layers, and that the calculated residual stress
   values are greater than those obtained experimentally. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Recent studies show that a broad category of materials share
   ``nonclassical{''} nonlinear elastic behavior much different from
   ``classical{''} (Landau-type) nonlinearity. Manifestations of
   ``nonclassical{''} nonlinearity include stress-strain hysteresis and
   discrete memory in quasistatic experiments, and specific dependencies of
   the harmonic amplitudes with respect to the drive amplitude in dynamic
   wave experiments, which are remarkably different from those predicted by
   the classical theory. These materials have in common soft ``bond{''}
   elements, where the elastic nonlinearity originates, contained in hard
   matter (e.g., a rock sample). The bond system normally comprises a small
   fraction of the total material volume, and can be localized (e.g., a
   crack in a solid) or distributed, as in a rock. In this paper a model is
   presented in which the soft elements are treated as hysteretic or
   reversible elastic units connected in a one-dimensional lattice to
   elastic elements (grains), which make up the hard matrix. Calculations
   are performed in the framework of the local interaction simulation
   approach (LISA). Experimental observations are well predicted by the
   model, which is now ready both for basic investigations about the
   physical origins of nonlinear elasticity and for applications to
   material damage diagnostics. (C) 2003 Acoustical Society of America.}},

Title = {{A hierarchical multi-physics model for design of high toughness steels}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-AIDED MATERIALS DESIGN}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{99-142}},
Abstract = {{In support of the computational design of high toughness steels as
   hierarchically structured materials, a multiscale, multiphysics
   methodology is developed for a `ductile fracture simulator.' At the
   nanometer scale, the method unites continuum mechanics with quantum
   physics, using first-principles calculations to predict the
   force-distance laws for interfacial separation with both normal and
   plastic sliding components. The predicted adhesion behavior is applied
   to the description of interfacial decohesion for both micron-scale
   primary inclusions governing primary void formation and submicron-scale
   secondary particles governing microvoid-based shear localization that
   accelerates primary void coalescence. Fine scale deformation is
   described by a `Particle Dynamics' method that extends the framework of
   molecular dynamics to multi-atom aggregates. This is combined with other
   meshfree and finite-element methods in two-level cell modeling to
   provide a hierarchical constitutive model for crack advance, combining
   conventional plasticity, microstructural damage, strain gradient effects
   and transformation plasticity from dispersed metastable austenite.
   Detailed results of a parallel experimental study of a commercial steel
   are used to calibrate the model at multiple scales. An initial
   application provides a Toughness-Strength-Adhesion diagram defining the
   relation among alloy strength, inclusion adhesion energy and fracture
   toughness as an aid to microstructural design.
   The analysis of this paper introduces an approach of creative steel
   design that can be stated as the exploration of the effective
   connections among the five key-components: elements selection, process
   design, micro/nanostructure optimization, desirable properties and
   industrial performance by virtue of innovations and inventions.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, a method for evaluating the fracture toughness of ceramics has
   been proposed by Fett based on the computed crack-opening displacements
   of cracks emanating from Vickers hardness indentations. To verify this
   method, experiments have been conducted to determine the toughness of a
   commercial silicon carbide ceramic, Hexoloy SA, by measuring the
   crack-opening profiles of such Vickers indentation cracks. Although the
   obtained toughness value of K-o = 2.3 MPa.m(1/2) is within 10\% of that
   measured using conventional fracture toughness testing, the computed
   crack-opening profiles corresponding to this toughness display poor
   agreement with those measured experimentally, raising concerns about the
   suitability of this method for determining the toughness of ceramics.
   The effects of subsurface cracking and cracking during loading are
   considered as possible causes of such discrepancies, with the former
   based on direct observations of lateral subsurface cracks below the

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SANDWICH STRUCTURES \& MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper addresses the effect of low velocity impact damage on
   post-impact failure mechanisms and structural integrity of foam core
   sandwich beams subjected to edgewise compression, shear and bending load
   cases. The study deals with a 2D configuration, where a sandwich beam is
   impacted by a steel cylinder across the whole width of the specimen. The
   impact damage is characterised as indentation of the core with
   sub-interface damage seen as a cavity while the GFRP faces remain
   virtually unaffected by the impact. Digital speckle photography (DSP)
   analysis is employed for in situ monitoring of crushing behaviour in the
   foam core during static indentation of sandwich specimens.
   The static shear strength of impact-damaged sandwich beams is compared
   with specimens with fabricated sub-interface cracks of the same length.
   DSP analysis reveals that the face-core interface in the peripheral
   regions of 2D impact damage is not entirely separated. The crack analogy
   is thus not fully representable since the surfaces remain bridged
   resulting in higher strength, when compared with fabricated cracks. The
   post-impact resistance to compressive loads is lower than for the
   specimens with fabricated cracks due to the presence of the cavity and
   the crushed core with reduced foundation stiffness support. The
   properties of crushed foam core are experimentally determined as they
   appear to be important for accurate modelling and analysis of the
   residual strength of sandwich beams. Modelling and post-impact analysis
   of the specimens with impact damage is elaborated in detail in part 11
   of this study.}},

Abstract = {{A framework is described for the development of a thermodynamically
   consistent plastic directional-damage-contact model for concrete. This
   framework is used as a basis for a new model, named Craft, which uses
   planes of degradation that can undergo damage and separation but which
   can regain contact according to a contact state function. The
   thermodynamic validity of the resulting model is considered in detail,
   and is proved for certain cases and demonstrated numerically for others.
   The model has a fully integrated plasticity component that uses a smooth
   triaxial yield surface and frictional hardening-softening functions. A
   new type of consistency condition is introduced for simultaneously
   maintaining both local and global constitutive relationships as well as
   stress transformation relationships. The introduction of contact theory
   provides the model with the ability to simulate the type of delayed
   aggregate interlock behavior exhibited by fully open crack surfaces that
   subsequently undergo significant shear movement. The model has been
   implemented in a constitutive driver program as well as a finite element
   program. The model is assessed against a range of experimental data,
   which includes data from uniaxial tension tests with and without
   unloading-reloading cycles, tests in which cracks are formed and then
   loaded in shear, and uniaxial, biaxial and triaxial compression tests.

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the development of a theoretical model to simulate
   the growth and repair of microdamage in bone. Unlike previous theories,
   which use simplified descriptions of damage, this approach models each
   individual microcrack explicitly, and also models the basic
   multicellular units (BMUs) that repair cracks. A computer simulation has
   been developed that is capable of making a variety of predictions.
   Firstly, we can predict the mechanical behaviour of dead bone in
   laboratory experiments, including estimates of the number of cycles to
   failure and the number and length of microcracks during fatigue tests.
   Secondly, we can predict the results of bone histomorphometry, including
   such parameters as BMU activation rates and the changing ratio of
   primary to secondary bone during ageing. Thirdly, we can predict the
   occurrence of stress fractures in living bone: these occur when the
   severity of loading is so great that cracks grow faster than they can be
   repaired. Finally, we can predict the phenomenon of adaptation, in which
   bone is deposited to increase cortical thickness and thus prevent stress
   fractures. In all cases results compare favourably with experimental and
   clinical data.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effects of transverse cracking and
   delamination on the S-0 mode velocity in GFRP and CFRP cross-ply
   laminates. We found experimentally that both the stiffness and the
   velocity decreased as the transverse crack density increased. In
   contrast, the stiffness decreased but the velocity increased as the
   delamination length increased. We analytically deduced the relationship
   between the velocity and the crack density from a combination of a
   shear-lag analysis and the classical plate theory. We also confirmed
   that the Lamb wave propagated through the 0degrees layers in the
   delaminated regions, and formulized the relationship between the
   velocity and the delamination length. The predicted crack density and
   delamination length using the measured velocity were in good agreement
   with the experimental results. This method is simple and promising for
   structural health monitoring of composite structures. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A microstructure-level simulation model was recently developed to
   characterize machining behavior of heterogeneous materials. During
   machining of heterogeneous materials such as cast iron, the material
   around the machining-affected zone undergoes reverse loading, which
   manifests itself in permanent material softening. In addition, cracks
   are formed below and ahead of the tool. To accurately simulate machining
   of heterogeneous materials the microstmcture-level model has to
   reproduce the effect of material softening on reverse loading (MSRL
   effect) and material damage. This paper describes procedures used to
   calculate the material behavior parameters for the aforementioned
   phenomena. To calculate the parameters associated with the MSRL effect,
   uniaxial reverse loading experiments and simulations were conducted
   using individual constituents of ductile iron. The material model was
   validated with reverse loading experiments of ductile iron specimens. To
   determine the parameters associated with fracture of each constituent,
   experiments and simulation of notched specimens are performed. During
   the validation stage, response of simulated ductile iron was in good
   agreement with the experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{This work addresses the computational aspects of a model for
   rigid-plastic damage. The model is a modification of a previous
   established model formulated by Perzyna (Recent Advances in Applied
   Mechanics, Academic Press: New York, 1966, p. 243-377 (Chapter 9)) which
   is here extended to include isotropic damage. Such an extension is
   obtained by incorporating the constitutive equations introduced by
   Lemaitre (J. Eng. Mater. Technol. 107 (1985) 83; Comput. Meth. Appl.
   Mech. Eng. 51 (1985) 31; A Course on Damage Mechanics, Springer, Berlin,
   Heidelberg, New York, 1996) for ductile plastic damage into the original
   model. In its original version (J. Eng. Mater. Technol. 107 (1985) 83;
   Comput. Meth. Appl. Mech. Eng. 51 (1985) 31) this model does not
   distinguish tension and compression in the damage evolution law, so it
   was necessary to introduce a refinement proposed by Ladeveze (in: J.P.
   Boehler, (Ed.), Proceedings of CNRS International Colloquium 351
   Villars-de-Lans, France (Failure Criteria of Structured Media, 1983, p.
   355) and Lemaitre (A Course on Damage Mechanics, Springer, Berlin,
   Heidelberg, New York, 1996) which takes into account the partial crack
   closure effect with isotropic damage. The accuracy of the computational
   model, developed for the analysis of the material degradation in bulk
   metal forming processes, is shown through the discussion of the results
   of two examples, allowing to compare the simulation results with
   experimental and numerical results obtained by other authors. (C) 2003
