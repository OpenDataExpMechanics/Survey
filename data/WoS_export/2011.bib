Abstract = {{The clinical success of modern dental ceramics depends on an array of
   factors, ranging from initial physical properties of the material

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to review existing literature in the area
   of nano-modification of asphalt and proceed to apply nano-materials to
   asphalt to improve the performance. This study integrates literature
   review, preparation, and characterization of nano-modified asphalt
   materials. In the experimental testing montmorillonite, nanoclay at 2\%
   and 4\% by weight of asphalt was blended in asphalt binder at a high
   temperature to exfoliate the nanoclay within the asphalt. The asphalt
   binder was then characterized using the Superpave (TM) rotational
   viscosity, dynamic shear modulus, and direct tension test. The
   rotational viscosity results indicate that the addition of the two types
   of nanoclay, Nanoclay A and Nanoclay 8, increased the rotational
   viscosity by an average of 41\% and 112\%, respectively, across test
   temperatures 80, 100, 130, 135, 150 and 175 degrees C. It was found that
   the dynamic shear complex modulus (G{*}) value increases significantly
   across a range of testing temperatures (from 13 to 70 degrees C) and
   loading frequencies (0.01-25 Hz). With 2\% Nanoclay A reinforcement in
   the asphalt binder, the complex shear moduli generally increased by 66\%
   while the 4\% Nanoclay A reinforcement in the asphalt binder generally
   increased the shear complex moduli by 125\%. The 2\% and 4\% Nanoclay B
   increased the shear complex moduli by 184\% and 196\%, respectively. In
   terms of direct tension strength, the use of Nanoclay A and Nanoclay B
   reduced the strain failure rate of the original binder while the secant
   or direct tension moduli showed increase with the addition of the
   nanoclays. In furtherance of this research, nanoclay-modified asphalt is
   being tested at percentages higher than 4\% to underscore the fact that
   nanoclays may have the potential to reduce rutting and cracking. (C)

Abstract = {{Time-dependent brittle deformation is a fundamental and pervasive
   process operating in the Earth's upper crust. Its characterization is a
   pre-requisite to understanding and unraveling the complexities of
   crustal evolution and dynamics. The preferential chemical interaction
   between pore fluids and strained atomic bonds at crack tips, a mechanism
   known as stress corrosion, allows rock to fail under a constant stress
   that is well below its short-term strength over an extended period of
   time: a process known as brittle creep. Here we present the first
   experimental measurements of brittle creep in a basic igneous rock (a
   basalt from Mt. Etna volcano) under triaxial stress conditions. Results
   from conventional creep experiments show that creep strain rates are
   highly dependent on the level of applied stress (and can be equally well
   fit by a power law or an exponential law): with a 20\% increase in
   stress producing close to three orders of magnitude increase in creep
   strain rate. Results from stress-stepping creep experiments show that
   creep strain rates are also influenced by the imposed effective
   confining pressure. We show that only part of this change can be
   attributed to the purely mechanical influence of an increase in
   effective pressure, with the remainder interpreted as due to a reduction
   in stress corrosion reactions; the result of a reduction in crack
   aperture that restricts the rate of transport of reactive species to
   crack tips. Overall, our results also suggest that a critical level of
   crack damage is required before the deformation starts to accelerate to
   failure, regardless of the level of applied stress and the time taken to
   reach this point. The experimental results are discussed in terms of
   microstructural observations and fits to a macroscopic creep law, and
   compared with the observed deformation history at Mt. Etna volcano. (c)

Title = {{The growth and coalescence of ellipsoidal voids in plane strain under

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{59}},

Abstract = {{New extensions of a model for the growth and coalescence of ellipsoidal
   voids based on the Gurson formalism are proposed in order to treat
   problems involving shear and/or voids axis not necessarily aligned with
   the main loading direction, under plane strain loading conditions. These
   extensions are motivated and validated using 3D finite element void cell
   calculations with overall plane strain enforced in one direction. The
   starting point is the Gologanu model dealing with spheroidal void shape.
   A void rotation law based on homogenization theory is coupled to this
   damage model. The predictions of the model closely agree with the 3D
   cell calculations, capturing the effect of the initial void shape and
   orientation on the void rotation rate. An empirical correction is also
   introduced for the change of the void aspect ratio in the plane
   transverse to the main axis of the void departing from its initially
   circular shape. This correction is needed for an accurate prediction of
   the onset of coalescence. Next, a new approach is proposed to take
   strain hardening into account within the Thomason criterion for internal
   necking, avoiding the use of strain hardening-dependent fitting
   parameters. The coalescence criterion is generalized to any possible
   direction of the coalescence plane and void orientation. Finally, the
   model is supplemented by a mathematical description of the final drop of
   the stress carrying capacity during coalescence. The entire model is
   developed for plane strain conditions, setting the path to a 3D
   extension. After validation of the model, a parametric study addresses
   the effect of shear on the ductility of metallic alloys for a range of
   microstructural and flow parameters, under different stress states. In
   general, the presence of shear, for identical stress triaxiality,
   decreases the ductility, partly explaining recent experimental results
   obtained in the low stress triaxiality regime. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Uniaxial compression experiments were performed for brittle sandstone
   samples containing a single fissure by a rock mechanics servo-controlled
   testing system. Based on the experimental results of axial stress-axial
   strain curves, the influence of single fissure geometry on the strength
   and deformation behavior of sandstone samples is analyzed in detail.
   Compared with the intact sandstone sample, the sandstone samples
   containing a single fissure show the localization deformation failure.
   The uniaxial compressive strength, Young's modulus and peak axial strain
   of sandstone samples with pre-existing single fissure are all lower than
   that of intact sandstone sample, which is closely related to the fissure
   length and fissure angle. The crack coalescence was observed and
   characterized from tips of pre-existing single fissure in brittle
   sandstone sample. Nine different crack types are identified based on
   their geometry and crack propagation mechanism (tensile, shear, lateral
   crack, far-field crack and surface spalling) for single fissure, which
   can be used to analyze the failure mode and cracking process of
   sandstone sample containing a single fissure under uniaxial compression.
   To confirm the subsequence of crack coalescence in sandstone sample, the
   photographic monitoring and acoustic emission (AE) technique were
   adopted for uniaxial compression test. The real-time crack coalescence
   process of sandstone containing a single fissure was recorded during the
   whole loading. In the end, the influence of the crack coalescence on the
   strength and deformation failure behavior of brittle sandstone sample
   containing a single fissure is analyzed under uniaxial compression. The
   present research is helpful to understand the failure behavior and
   fracture mechanism of engineering rock mass (such as slope instability
   and underground rock burst).}},

   of 19 unconfined uniaxial compression tests were performed utilizing
   servo-controlled testing procedures. All specimens were tested at their
   natural water content with loading approximately normal to the bedding.
   Acoustic emission (AE) measurements were utilized to help quantify
   stress levels associated with crack initiation and propagation. The
   unconfined compression strength of the tested specimens averaged 6.9
   MPa. The crack initiation threshold occurred at approximately 30\% of
   the rupture stress based on analyzing both the acoustic emission
   measurements and the stress-strain behavior. The crack damage threshold
   showed large variability and occurred at approximately 70\% of the
   rupture stress.}},

Abstract = {{The initiation and evolution of transverse matrix cracks and
   delaminations are predicted within a mesh-independent cracking (MIC)
   framework. MIC is a regularized extended finite element method (x-FEM)
   that allows the insertion of cracks in directions that are independent
   of the mesh orientation. The Heaviside step function that is typically
   used to introduce a displacement discontinuity across a crack surface is
   replaced by a continuous function approximated by using the original
   displacement shape functions. Such regularization allows the
   preservation of the Gaussian integration schema regardless of the
   enrichment required to model cracking in an arbitrary direction. The
   interaction between plies is anchored on the integration point
   distribution, which remains constant through the entire simulation.
   Initiation and propagation of delaminations between plies as well as
   intra-ply MIC opening is implemented by using a mixed-mode cohesive
   formulation in a fully three-dimensional model that includes residual
   thermal stresses. The validity of the proposed methodology was tested
   against a variety of problems ranging from simple evolution of
   delamination from existing transverse cracks to strength predictions of
   complex laminates without a priori knowledge of damage location or
   initiation. Good agreement with conventional numerical solutions and/or
   experimental data was observed in all the problems considered. Published

Abstract = {{In this paper we focus on the external sulfate attack on concrete
   specimens at the meso-level. There is nowadays a renewed interest in
   rationally describing the mechanisms behind expansive processes leading
   to cracking and spalling of concrete exposed to sulfate solutions. A
   model is presented for degradation of concrete exposed to external
   sulfate attack at the meso-level, i.e. representing explicitly in the
   simulations the main heterogeneities of the material. A previously
   developed mesomechanical approach has been coupled with a
   diffusion-reaction analysis at the same scale. It is based on the
   systematic use of zero-thickness interface elements equipped with
   fracture-based constitutive laws, and the effect of discrete cracks on
   the transport of ions is explicitly accounted for. The main results
   obtained agree qualitatively and quantitatively well with experimental
   observations in terms of ettringite penetration depth, expansions, crack
   patterns and spalling effects. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The behavior of concrete structures is strongly influenced by the
   loading rate. Compared to quasi-static loading concrete loaded by impact
   loading acts in a different way. First, there is a strain-rate influence
   on strength, stiffness, and ductility, and, second, there are inertia
   forces activated. Both influences are clearly demonstrated in
   experiments. Moreover, for concrete structures, which exhibit damage and
   fracture phenomena, the failure mode and cracking pattern depend on
   loading rate. In general, there is a tendency that with the increase of
   loading rate the failure mode changes from mode-I to mixed mode.
   Furthermore, theoretical and experimental investigations indicate that
   after the crack reaches critical speed of propagation there is crack
   branching. The present paper focuses on 3D finite-element study of the
   crack propagation of the concrete compact tension specimen. The rate
   sensitive microplane model is used as a constitutive law for concrete.
   The strain-rate influence is captured by the activation energy theory.
   Inertia forces are implicitly accounted for through dynamic finite
   element analysis. The results of the study show that the fracture of the
   specimen strongly depends on the loading rate. For relatively low
   loading rates there is a single crack due to the mode-I fracture.
   However, with the increase of loading rate crack branching is observed.
   Up to certain threshold (critical) loading rate the maximal crack
   velocity increases with increase of loading rate, however, for higher
   loading rates maximal velocity of the crack propagation becomes
   independent of the loading rate. The critical crack velocity at the
   onset of crack branching is found to be approximately 500 m/s. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Computational modelling techniques are now widely employed in materials
   science, due to recent advances in computing power and simulation
   methodologies, since they can enable rapid testing of theoretical
   predictions or understanding of complex experimental data at relatively
   low cost. However, many problems at the leading edge of materials
   science involve collective phenomena that occur over a range of time and
   length scales which are intrinsically difficult to capture in a single
   simulation. This review summarises some of the latest developments in
   multiscale modelling techniques over the past decade, as applied to
   selected problems in materials science and engineering, thereby
   motivating the reader to explore how such techniques might be applied in
   their own area of specialty. Methods for accelerating molecular dynamics
   by enhancement of kinetic barrier crossing, such as hyperdynamics and
   metadynamics, are discussed alongside mesoscale simulation techniques,
   such as dissipative particle dynamics or adaptive coarse graining, for
   enabling larger and longer simulations. The applications are mainly
   focused on simulations of microstructure and mechanical properties, and
   examples of surface diffusion in metals, radiation damage in ceramics,
   strengthening of nanocrystalline metals and alloys, crack propagation in
   brittle solids, polymer chain relaxation in nanocomposites and the
   control of nucleation in biomimetic materials are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The augmented finite element method (A-FEM) is used to study the
   fundamental composite failure problem of delamination and associated
   damage events spreading from a stress concentrator during tensile
   loading. The solution exploits the ability of A-FEM to account for
   coupled multiple crack types that are not predetermined in shape or
   number. The nonlinear processes of each fracture mode are represented by
   a cohesive model, which provides a unified description of crack
   initiation and propagation and can also describe crack coalescence and
   bifurcation. The study problem is an orthogonal double-notched tension
   specimen, in which delaminations interact with transverse ply cracks,
   intra-ply splitting cracks, non-localized fine-scale matrix shear
   deformation, and fiber breaks. Cohesive laws and constitutive laws for
   matrix shear deformation are calibrated using literature data from
   independent tests. The calibrated simulations are mesh independent and
   correctly reproduce all qualitative aspects of the coupled damage
   evolution processes. They also correctly predict delamination sizes and
   shapes, the density of transverse ply cracks, the growth rate of
   splitting cracks, softening of the global stress-strain curve, and the
   ultimate strength. A sensitivity analysis relates variability in
   cohesive law parameters to predicted deviance in engineering properties.
   Given the known variability in cohesive law parameters, the predicted
   deviance in ultimate strength agrees with that in experimental data. The
   importance of including the interactions between different crack systems
   and non-localized shear deformation is demonstrated by suppressing the
   presence of separate mechanisms; the predicted delamination shapes,
   splitting crack growth rate, and the stress-displacement relationship
   fall into significant error. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Due to their large aggregates size and their heterogeneous
   microstructure, concretes are difficult materials to test at high
   strain-rates. Direct tensile tests, spalling tests and edge-on impact
   experiments have been especially developed and performed on a standard
   concrete (max grain size of 8 mm). The influence of free water on the
   high strain rate behaviour has been carefully evaluated. Numerical
   simulations of dynamic testing have been also performed using a
   mesoscopic approach in which the matrix and the aggregates are
   differentiated. Numerical and analytical homogenization methods have
   been employed to define a model-concrete which fits experimental data of
   simple and oedometric compression tests. Then, the numerical simulations
   with several random distributions of aggregates were conducted to
   validate the processing methods applied to the experimental data of the
   dynamic tests. Moreover an anisotropic damage model coupled to the
   mesoscopic approach has been used to simulate the dynamic behaviour of
   concrete under impact. It allows predicting the increase of strength and
   cracking density with strain-rate and the free water influence on the
   dynamic behaviour of concrete. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Self-healing materials have the ability to `repair' themselves upon
   exposure to an external stimulus. In the field of coatings, extensive
   laboratory research has been conducted on these so-called smart
   materials in the last decade. In the present work, a self-healing
   concept for epoxy-based anticorrosive coatings, based on incorporation
   of microcapsules, filled with reactive agents, into the coating matrix,
   is investigated. Upon small damages to the coating, the reagents are
   released from the capsules and react, thereby forming a cross-linked
   network, which heals the crack However, for the concept to work,
   microcapsules have to be strong enough to remain intact during storage
   and coating formulation and application. Furthermore, the capsules must
   remain stable for many years in the dry coating. Laboratory experiments,
   using four out of several encapsulation methods available in the
   literature, have been conducted to investigate the challenges associated
   with the synthesis of stable microcapsules. It was found that the nature
   of the core material strongly affects the microcapsule stability and
   performance. Furthermore, it was evident that experimental procedures
   developed for certain core materials were not suitable for encapsulation
   of other compounds without modifications. This is a severe limitation as
   not many of the encapsulation procedures have been developed for
   industrially relevant core materials such as epoxy resin. Results of
   experiments, aiming at finding optimal conditions for robust
   microcapsule production, are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

   axially in the sample, with bursts of crack growth. However, GaAs
   micropillars with diameters less than approximately 1 mu m did not
   split, nor was splitting observed where slip occurred on only one plane.
   The conditions under which such splitting can occur have been estimated
   by modifying an existing analysis. This predicts a ductile-brittle
   transition at a micropillar diameter of approximately 1 mu m, consistent

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study of the effects of ply clustering on
   polymer-based laminated composite plates subjected to a drop-weight

   These tools are simplified analytical models for the description of the
   impact behavior and of the damage thresholds that result in a
   significant reduction on the structure stiffness and strength, caused by
   delamination. The results obtained demonstrate that the analytical tools
   are useful to define the impact configurations, to obtain a preliminary
   understanding of the effects of each parameter that can influence the
   response, and to interpret the experimental results. It is concluded
   that ply clustering reduces the damage resistance of the structure.
   However, the damage tolerance assessed by the compression after impact
   tests is unaffected by ply clustering. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{To test the applicability of the x-ray attenuation method to monitor

   corrosion-induced cracks. Also, x-ray attenuation measurements allowed
   determination of the actual concentration of the corrosion products
   averaged through the specimen thickness. The total mass loss of steel,
   obtained by the x-ray attenuation method, was found to be in very good
   agreement with the mass loss obtained by gravimetric method as well as

Abstract = {{This article explores the use of principal component analysis (PCA) and
   T-2 and Q-statistic measures to detect and distinguish damages in
   structures. For this study, two structures are used for experimental
   assessment: a steel sheet and a turbine blade of an aircraft. The
   analysis has been performed in two ways: (i) by exciting the structure
   with low-frequency vibrations using a shaker and using several
   piezoelectric (PZT) sensors attached on the surface, and (ii) by
   exciting at high-frequency vibrations using a single PZT as actuator and
   several PZTs as sensors. A known vibration signal is applied and the
   dynamical responses are analyzed. A PCA model is built using data from
   the undamaged structure as a reference base line. The defects in the
   turbine blade are simulated by attaching a mass on the surface at
   different positions. Instead, a progressive crack is produced to the
   steel sheet. Data from sets of experiments for undamaged and damaged
   scenarios are projected into the PCA model. The first two projections,
   and the Q-statistic and T-2-statistic indices are analyzed. Q-statistic
   indicates how well each sample conforms to the PCA model. It is a
   measure of the difference or residual between a sample and its
   projection into the principal components retained in the model.
   T-2-statistic index is a measure of the variation of each sample within
   the PCA model. Results of each scenario are presented and discussed
   demonstrating the feasibility and potential of using this formulation in
   structural health monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{The behavior of masonry-infilled reinforced concrete frames under cyclic
   lateral loading is complicated because a number of different failure
   mechanisms can be induced by the frame-infill interaction, including
   brittle shear failures of the concrete columns and damage of the infill
   walls. In this study, nonlinear finite element models have been used to
   simulate the behavior of these structures. Diffused cracking and
   crushing in concrete and masonry are described by a smeared-crack
   continuum model, while dominant cracks as well as masonry mortar joints
   are modeled with a cohesive crack interface model. The interface model
   adopts an elasto-plastic formulation to describe the mixed-mode fracture
   of concrete and masonry. The model accounts for cyclic crack opening and
   closing, reversible shear dilatation, and joint compaction due to
   damage. The constitutive models have been validated with experimental
   data and successfully applied to the dynamic analysis of a three-story,
   two-bay, masonry-infilled, non-ductile, reinforced concrete frame tested
   on a shake table. The results have demonstrated the capabilities of the
   finite element method in capturing the nonlinear cyclic
   load-displacement response and failure mechanisms of the structure, and
   indicated the important contribution of infill walls to the seismic
   resistance of a non-ductile reinforced concrete frame. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new approach for damage detection in beam-like
   structures with small cracks, whose crack ratio {[}r = H-c/H] is less
   than 5\%, without baseline modal parameters. The approach is based on
   the difference of the continuous wavelet transforms (CWTs) of two sets
   of mode shape data which correspond to the left half and the right half
   of the modal data of a cracked simply-supported beam. The mode shape
   data of a cracked beam are apparently smooth curves, but actually
   exhibit local peaks or dis-continuities in the region of damage because
   they include additional response due to the cracks. The modal responses
   of the damaged simply-supported beams used are computed using the finite
   element method. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed
   method for crack detection, and they provide a better crack indicator
   than the result of the CWT of the original mode shape data. The effects
   of crack location and sampling interval are examined. The simulated and
   experimental results show that the proposed method has great potential
   in crack detection of beam-like structures as it does not require the
   modal parameter of an uncracked beam as a baseline for crack detection.
   It can be recommended for real applications. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper provides experimental validation of the approach for

   damage is defined by the ratio of the plastic strain increment to the
   fracture strain, and total damage is calculated using linear summation.
   When the accumulated damage becomes unity, all stress components at the
   finite element gauss point are reduced to a small value to simulate
   progressive failure. The proposed method is validated against four
   experimental data sets of cracked specimens made of three different
   materials. Despite the simplicity of the proposed method, the simulated
   results agree well with experimental data for all cases considered,
   providing sufficient confidence in the use of the proposed method to

Abstract = {{The successful invention of self-healing polymer composites a decade ago
   necessitated a methodology to quantify the ability of the material to
   heal and recover structural properties following damage. Healing
   efficiency was defined as the ratio of healed to virgin fracture
   toughness, eta = K-IChealed/K-ICvirgin. Early work took advantage of the
   crack length independence offered by a tapered double-cantilever beam
   (TDCB) fracture geometry to simplify calculation of healing efficiency
   to the ratio of healed to virgin critical loads, eta =
   P-Chealed/P-Cvirgin. The current work investigates the application of
   the TDCB geometry and three common geometries utilized in the broader
   fracture literature (the compact tension (CT), single-edge notch bend
   (SENB), and single-edge notch tension (SENT) geometries) to the
   measurement of healing efficiency. While the TDCB geometry simplifies
   the calculation of healing efficiency because the crack lengths do not
   need to be accounted for, it is shown that if the virgin and healed
   crack lengths are not accurately accounted when using the CT, SENB, and
   SENT geometries, errors in calculated healing efficiency can be several
   hundred per cent. The TDCB geometry is reviewed at length, including the
   underlying theory and experimental calibration and validation of TDCB
   geometry.}},

Abstract = {{The main drawback of a conventional stenting procedure is the high risk
   of restenosis. The idea of a stent that ``disappears{''} after having
   fulfilled its mission is very intriguing and fascinating, since it can
   be expected that the stent mass decreases in time to allow the gradual
   transmission of the mechanical load to the surrounding tissues owing to
   controlled dissolution by corrosion. Magnesium and its alloys are
   appealing materials for designing biodegradable stents.
   The objective of this work is to develop, in a finite element framework,
   a model of magnesium degradation that is able to predict the corrosion
   rate, thus providing a valuable tool for the design of bioresorbable
   stents. Continuum damage mechanics is suitable for modeling several
   damage mechanisms, including different types of corrosion. In this
   study, the damage is assumed to be the superposition of stress corrosion
   and uniform microgalvanic corrosion processes. The former describes the
   stress-mediated localization of the corrosion attack through a
   stress-dependent evolution law, while the latter affects the free
   surface of the material exposed to an aggressive environment.
   Comparisons with experimental tests show that the developed model can
   reproduce the behavior of different magnesium alloys subjected to static
   corrosion tests. The study shows that parameter identification for a
   correct calibration of the model response on the results of uniform and
   stress corrosion experimental tests is reachable. Moreover,
   three-dimensional stenting procedures accounting for interaction with
   the arterial vessel are simulated, and it is shown how the proposed
   modeling approach gives the possibility of accounting for the combined
   effects of an aggressive environment and mechanical loading. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Cracking is a main source of structural distress in asphalt materials
   and asphaltic pavements. To predict crack-associated fracture damage in
   asphalt mixtures, this study presents a model using the finite-element
   method and a cohesive zone fracture model. The approach allows advanced
   characterization of the microstructural damage evolution in a more
   realistic length scale, the mixture heterogeneity, the inelastic
   material behavior, and the interactions among mixture constituents. The
   model presented herein accounts for (1) actual mixture heterogeneity by
   using digital image techniques; (2) inelastic material behavior based on
   elastic-viscoelastic constitutive relations; and (3) microscale fracture
   damage represented by the cohesive zone fracture model. A computational
   modeling framework is presented, and the applicability of the model is
   demonstrated through simulations. Model simulations are further analyzed
   by comparing numerical predictions to laboratory test results and by
   conducting parametric analyses of fracture properties. It is expected
   that the successfully developed computational model can provide better
   insights into the effect of mixture constituents on overall mixture
   performance, while minimizing modeling efforts and producing more
   accurate simulations than traditional approaches, with significant
   savings in experimental costs and time.}},

   multiresponse problem. There are two output variables, depth of cut and
   cutting width whose optimization will result in the increase in the
   productivity of coal cutting. In this paper, a Taguchi-Fuzzy decision
   method has been used to determine the effective process parameters for
   improving the productivity of coal mines. The Taguchi method of
   experimental design is a widely accepted technique used for producing
   high quality products at low cost. The optimization of multiple
   responses in complex processes is common; therefore, to reduce the
   degree of uncertainty during the decision making, fuzzy rule-based
   reasoning was integrated with the Taguchi loss function.}},

Abstract = {{To examine the performance of nonlinear models proposed in the
   estimation of fatigue damage and fatigue life of components under random
   loading, a batch of specimens made of 6082 T 6 aluminium alloy has been
   studied and some of the results are reported in the present paper. The
   paper describes an algorithm and suggests a fatigue cumulative damage
   model, especially when random loading is considered. This paper contains
   the results of mono-axial random load fatigue tests with different mean
   and amplitude values performed on 6082 T 6 aluminium alloy specimens.
   Cycles were counted with rainflow algorithm and damage was cumulated
   with a new model proposed in this paper and with the Palmgren-Miner
   model. The proposed model has been formulated to take into account the
   damage evolution at different load levels and it allows the effect of
   the loading sequence to be included by means of a recurrence formula
   derived for multilevel loading, considering complex load sequences. It
   is concluded that a `damaged stress interaction damage rule' proposed
   here allows a better fatigue damage prediction than the widely used
   Palmgren-Miner rule, and a formula derived in random fatigue could be
   used to predict the fatigue damage and fatigue lifetime very easily. The
   results obtained by the model are compared with the experimental results
   and those calculated by the most fatigue damage model used in fatigue
   (Miner's model). The comparison shows that the proposed model, presents
   a good estimation of the experimental results. Moreover, the error is
   minimized in comparison to the Miner's model. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Research on fatigue crack formation from a corroded 7075-T651 surface
   provides insight into the governing mechanical driving forces at
   microstructure-scale lengths that are intermediate between safe life and
   damage tolerant feature sizes. Crack surface marker-bands accurately
   quantify cycles (N(i)) to form a 10-20 mu m fatigue crack emanating from
   both an isolated pit perimeter and EXCO corroded surface. The N(i)
   decreases with increasing-applied stress. Fatigue crack formation
   involves a complex interaction of elastic stress concentration due to
   three-dimensional pit macro-topography coupled with local
   micro-topographic plastic strain concentration, further enhanced by
   microstructure (particularly sub-surface constituents). These driving
   force interactions lead to high variability in cycles to form a fatigue
   crack, but from an engineering perspective, a broadly corroded surface
   should contain an extreme group of features that are likely to drive the
   portion of life to form a crack to near 0. At low-applied stresses,
   crack formation can constitute a significant portion of life, which is
   predicted by coupling macro-pit and micro-feature elastic-plastic
   stress/strain concentrations from finite element analysis with empirical
   low-cycle fatigue life models. The presented experimental results
   provide a foundation to validate next-generation crack formation models
   and prognosis methods.}},

Abstract = {{Adhesive-bonding for the unions in structures is gaining momentum over
   welding, riveting and fastening. It is vital for the design of bonded
   structures the availability of reliable damage models to predict their
   fracture behaviour. Cohesive Zone Models (CZM's) have been extensively
   used in the past, taking advantage of traction-separation laws between
   stresses and relative displacements to simulate crack growth along
   predefined paths. The eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) is a recent
   improvement of the Finite Element Method (FEM) that relies on damage
   laws based on the bulk strength of materials for damage initiation and
   strain for the assessment of failure, rather than the tipping tractions
   and tensile/shear relative displacements used for the CZM's. Compared to
   the FEM, XFEM excels in allowing discontinuities to grow within bulk
   solids along an arbitrary path. This work aims to assess the viability
   of the XFEM to predict the fracture behaviour of a thin layer of
   adhesive between stiff and compliant adherends. To build the XFEM damage
   laws, the fracture toughness in pure mode I (G(Ic)) and tensile cohesive
   strength (sigma(0)(n)) of the two adhesives were initially determined by
   Double-Cantilever Beam (DCB) and bulk tensile tests, respectively.
   Particular emphasis was given to G(Ic), as this is the most influent
   parameter for the numerical predictions. The numerical simulations of
   the DCB tests with the proposed laws matched accurately the experimental
   load-displacement (P-delta) curves, which validated the analysis
   procedure. The accuracy of the data reduction methods for calculation of
   G(Ic) was checked by comparison of the input values in the simulations
   with the results of G(Ic) calculations, with good results. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The risk of fracture increases with age due to the decline of bone mass
   and bone quality. One of the age-related changes in bone quality occurs
   through the formation and accumulation of advanced glycation
   end-products (AGEs) due to non-enzymatic glycation (NEG). However as a
   number of other changes including increased porosity occur with age and
   affect bone fragility, the relative contribution of AGEs on the fracture
   resistance of aging bone is unknown. Using a high-resolution nonlinear
   finite element model that incorporate cohesive elements and
   micro-computed tomography-based 3d meshes, we investigated the
   contribution of AGEs and cortical porosity on the fracture toughness of
   human bone. The results show that NEG caused a 52\% reduction in
   propagation fracture toughness (R-curve slope). The combined effects of
   porosity and AGEs resulted in an 88\% reduction in propagation
   toughness. These findings are consistent with previous experimental
   results. The model captured the age-related changes in the R-curve
   toughening by incorporating bone quantity and bone quality changes, and
   these simulations demonstrate the ability of the cohesive models to
   account for the irreversible dynamic crack growth processes affected by
   the changes in post-yield material behavior. By decoupling the
   matrix-level effects due to NEG and intracortical porosity, we are able
   to directly determine the effects of NEG on fracture toughness. The
   outcome of this study suggests that it may be important to include the
   age-related changes in the material level properties by using finite
   element analysis towards the prediction of fracture risk. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{This work examines the performance of composite panels when subjected to
   underwater impulsive loads. The scaled fluid-structure experimental
   methodology developed by Espinosa and co-workers was employed. Failure
   modes, damage mechanisms and their distributions were identified and
   quantified for composite monolithic and sandwich panels subjected to
   typical blast loadings. The temporal evolutions of panel deflection and
   center deflection histories were obtained from shadow Moire fringes
   acquired in real time by means of high speed photography. A linear
   relationship of zero intercept between peak center deflections versus
   applied impulse per areal mass was obtained for composite monolithic
   panels. For composite sandwich panels, the relationship between maximum
   center deflection versus applied impulse per areal mass was found to be
   approximately bilinear but with a higher slope. Performance improvement
   of sandwich versus monolithic composite panels was, therefore,
   established specially at sufficiently high impulses per areal mass
   (I(0)/(M) over bar > 170 m s(-1)). Severe failure was observed in solid
   panels subjected to impulses per areal mass larger than 300 m s(-1).
   Extensive fiber fracture occurred in the center of the panels, where
   cracks formed a cross pattern through the plate thickness and
   delamination was very extensive on the sample edges due to bending
   effects. Similar levels of damage were observed in sandwich panels but
   at much higher impulses per areal mass. The experimental work reported
   in this paper encompasses not only characterization of the dynamic
   performance of monolithic and sandwich panels but also post-mortem
   characterization by means of both non-destructive and microscopy
   techniques. The spatial distribution of delamination and matrix cracking
   were quantified, as a function of applied impulse, in both monolithic
   and sandwich panels. The extent of core crushing was also quantified in
   the case of sandwich panels. The quantified variables represent ideal
   metrics against which model predictive capabilities can be assessed. (C)

Abstract = {{Fatigue failure due to repetitive loading of metallic devices is a
   pervasive engineering concern. The present work reveals extraordinary
   fatigue resistance in nanocrystalline (NC) alloys, which appears to be
   associated with the small (< 100 nm) grain size inhibiting traditional
   cyclic damage processes. In this study, we examine the fatigue
   performance of three electrodeposited NC Ni-based metals: Ni, Ni-0.5Mn,
   and Ni-22Fe (PERMALLOY). When subjected to fatigue stresses at and above
   the tensile yield strength where conventional coarse-grained (CG)
   counterparts undergo low-cycle fatigue failure (< 10(4) cycles to
   failure), these alloys exhibit exceptional fatigue lives (in some cases,
   > 10(7) cycles to failure). Postmortem examinations show that failed
   samples contain an aggregate of coarsened grains at the crack initiation
   site. The experimental data and accompanying microscopy suggest that the
   NC matrix undergoes abnormal grain growth during cyclic loading,
   allowing dislocation activity to persist over length scales necessary to
   initiate a fatigue crack by traditional fatigue mechanisms. Thus, the
   present observations demonstrate anomalous fatigue behavior in two
   regards: (1) quantitatively anomalous when considering the extremely
   high stress levels needed to drive fatigue failure and (2)
   mechanistically anomalous in light of the grain growth process that
   appears to be a necessary precursor to crack initiation.}},

Abstract = {{Uniaxial quasi-static compression, uniaxial dynamic compression and
   confined dynamic compression experiments were performed to characterize
   the failure of Aluminum Nitride (AlN) using a servo hydraulic machine
   and a modified Kolsky bar set-up respectively. High-speed digital
   cameras are used to visualize the failure processes. A summary of the
   available experimental results, including that in the literature, shows
   that the compressive strength of the AIN is sensitive to strain rate in
   the range from 10(-3) to 10(3) s(-1), that the deviatoric strength of
   AIN is linearly dependent on pressure at low pressures and nearly
   independent of pressure above a transitional pressure (about 2 GPa). TEM
   characterization of fragments obtained after dynamic loading is used to
   characterize the deformation mechanisms in the AIN for varying
   confinement. The transition in the pressure dependent behavior is shown
   to be the result of a change of deformation mechanism. Classical wing
   crack micromechanics is used to predict the transition in the
   deformation mechanism, and to explain the observed behavior at low
   pressure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A method for crack-free machining of deep cavity in alumina is
   demonstrated using a low-cost CO2 continuous wave (CW) laser. CO2 laser
   underwater machining has been found to result in reducing substrate
   defects such as recast layer, dross, cracking and heat damages that are
   typically found in machining in air. Finite Element (FE) modelling
   technique and Smooth Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) modelling technique
   were employed to understand the effect of water on crack resistance and
   debris removal during underwater machining. Also the microstructures of
   machined region were demonstrated to reveal different heating and
   cooling processes during laser machining in water and in air. The
   experimental results indicated that the machined kerf width was strongly
   affected by the water layer thickness, whereas the kerf depth was
   controlled by both the laser pass number and water layer thickness. The
   optimal average machining rate was up to 2.95 mm(3)/min at a 60W laser
   power. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   a three-dimensional model was derived and coupled with the cracking
   energy density criterion to predict the fatigue life of SBR. The
   capabilities of the model, which requires only three damage parameters

Abstract = {{Scatter observed in the fatigue response of a nickel-based superalloy,
   U720, is linked to the variability in the microstructure. Our approach
   is to model the energy of a persistent slip band (PSB) structure and use
   its stability with respect to dislocation motion as our failure
   criterion for fatigue crack initiation. The components that contribute
   to the energy of the PSB are identified, namely, the stress field
   resulting from the applied external forces, dislocation pile-ups, and
   work-hardening of the material is calculated at the continuum scale.
   Further, energies for dislocations creating slip in the
   matrix/precipitates, interacting with the GBs, and
   nucleating/agglomerating within the PSB are computed via molecular
   dynamics simulations. Through this methodology, fatigue life is
   predicted based on the energy of the PSB, which inherently accounts for
   the microstructure of the material. The present approach circumvents the
   introduction of uncertainty principles in material properties. It builds
   a framework based on mechanics of microstructure, and from this
   framework, we construct simulated microstructures based on the measured
   distributions of grain size, orientation, neighbor information, and
   grain boundary character, which allows us to calculate fatigue scatter
   using a deterministic approach. The uniqueness of the approach is that
   it avoids the large number of parameters prevalent in previous fatigue
   models. The predicted lives are in excellent agreement with the
   experimental data validating the model capabilities. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Windshield is one of the most important components in automobile to
   protect pedestrian and passenger, as well as enhance vehicle
   crashworthiness. The most widely used material for windshield is
   polyvinyl butyral (PVB) laminated glass. This paper uses both
   quasi-static compression and dynamic Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB)
   compression experiments under different strain/loading rates to
   investigate the mechanical behavior of PVB laminated glass. Experimental
   results show that PVB laminated glass is a strong rate-dependent
   material with nonlinearity in its constitutive behavior under both
   quasi-static and dynamic loading circumstances. In quasi-static cases,
   major failure onset (MFO) strain increases with the loading rate while
   MFO stress remains the same; however MFO strain and stress will both
   increase in higher strain rates in dynamic loading. A constitutive model
   covering all strain/loading rates is then established based on
   Johnson-Cook model mathematically. Further, crack branching based on
   crack fractal theory is investigated and an explicit expression
   describing the crack velocity and number of crack branching is proposed.
   In addition, dynamic stress intensify factor is calculated to be beta
   approximate to 1.5 and an ``impact caused brittleness{''} effect in PVB
   laminated material is discussed. Results can provide important
   experiment data and useful model to further research on vehicle crash
   safety. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study has been carried out to determine the critical
   damage parameter based on the concept of entropy flow. The fatigue
   damage is either a cumulative process that progresses toward a maximum
   tolerable damage, or is an irreversible progression of cyclic plastic
   strain energy that reaches its critical value at the onset of fracture.
   In the present study, irreversible heat dissipation in terms of entropy
   is utilized to experimentally determine the degradation of different
   specimens subjected to low cyclic bending fatigue. An experimental
   correlation between entropy and damage is proposed. It is shown that the
   cyclic energy dissipation in the form of thermodynamic entropy can be
   effectively utilized to determine the critical damage value.}},

Abstract = {{This experimental work documents the mechanical evolution of synthetic
   glass (SON68) under compressive triaxial stresses (hydrostatic and
   deviatoric conditions). The experimental setup enabled to monitor and
   vary independently confining pressure (range: {[}0,50] MPa) and axial
   stress (up to 680 MPa) at room temperature. An optimized set of sensors
   allowed us to perform measurements during the experiments of: (i) axial
   and radial deformation, (ii) P- and S-elastic wave velocities, and (iii)
   acoustic emissions. In addition, in some samples, initial crack
   densities up to a value of 0.24 were introduced by thermal cracking. We
   compare the original synthetic glass data set to results obtained in the
   same experimental conditions on thermally cracked glass and on a
   basaltic rock with similar petrophysical properties (porosity,
   chemistry).
   Stress-strain data depict original linear elastic glass properties even
   up to an axial stress of 680 MPa (under 15 MPa confining pressure). A
   strong strength decrease (370 MPa at 15 MPa confining pressure) is
   observed for thermally cracked samples. Elastic wave velocity data
   highlight that cracks are mostly closed at a confining pressure of
   similar to 30 MPa. The basaltic rock seems to correspond to an
   intermediate state between an original and a thermally treated glass. In
   all samples, damage was accompanied by dynamic crack propagation,
   producing large magnitude acoustic emissions. Thanks to a continuous
   recorder, we could locate a number of acoustic emissions in order to
   image the microcracking pattern evolution prior to failure. (C) 2010

Volume = {{200}},
Number = {{9-12}},
Pages = {{917-930}},
Abstract = {{This paper contributes to the formulation of continuum damage models for
   orthotropic materials under plane stress conditions. Two stress
   transformation tensors, related to tensile and compressive stress
   states, respectively, are used to establish a one-to-one mapping
   relationship between the orthotropic behaviour and an auxiliary model.
   This allows the consideration of two individual damage criteria,
   according to different failure mechanisms, i.e. cracking and crushing.
   The constitutive model adopted in the mapped space makes use of two
   scalar variables which monitor the local damage under tension and
   compression, respectively. The model affords the simulation of
   orthotropic induced damage, while also accounting for unilateral
   effects, thanks to a stress tensor split into tensile and compressive
   contributions. The fundamentals of the method are presented together
   with the procedure utilized to adjust the model in order to study the
   mechanical behaviour of masonry material. The validation of the model is
   carried out by means of comparisons with experimental results on
   different types of orthotropic masonry at the material level. (C) 2010

Title = {{Modeling in-plane and out-of-plane displacement fields in pull-off tests
   on FRP strips}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{3715-3725}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The present paper deals with modeling FRP strips bonded to concrete
   blocks and tested in pull-off. The investigation starts from the
   experimental observations obtained by means of an optical
   image-correlation measurement system which is able to monitor the 3D
   displacement components of a fine mesh of points on the surface of both
   the FRP strip and concrete block. Thus, refined measurements of both
   in-plane and out-of-plane displacements of the FRP strips are available.
   A brief overview of the key contributions available in the scientific
   literature on modeling the bond behavior of FRP strips glued to a
   concrete substrate is firstly proposed. Then, a novel model based on
   simulating the behavior of the FRP strip as a Bernoulli beam on a layer
   of springs is formulated. It is aimed at determining the 2D displacement
   field of the FRP strip during a pull-off test up to debonding which
   actually occurs in a mixed fracture mode. The model is firstly
   formulated within the linear range by assuming elastic behavior for the
   above mentioned springs. The nonlinear behavior due to the cracking of
   concrete beneath the adhesive interface is then introduced for
   simulating the above mentioned experimental results. In particular, a
   bilinear relationship is assumed between interface slips and shear
   stresses, as is generally accepted within the scientific literature.
   Furthermore, a damage model is considered for reducing the stiffness of
   the transverse springs and simulating the crack propagation at the
   adhesive-concrete interface. Although this is a simplified way of
   modeling the nonlinear behavior of concrete in shear/tension, it results
   in rather accurate simulations of the available experimental results. In
   fact, it can simulate accurately the overall behavior observed in three
   experimental tests on specimens characterized by significantly different
   mechanical properties of the strip. Since the model assumes a small set
   of mechanical parameters for describing the mechanical behavior of the
   adhesive FRP-concrete interface and results in a reasonable small set of
   equations, it can be easily employed for identifying the above mentioned
   mechanical behavior indirectly. Other numerical models already available
   in the scientific literature (especially those based on the theory of
   finite elements) for simulating the 2D displacement field in the
   debonding stage are generally based on much more equations and require a
   much higher computational effort which makes impractical their use in an
   indirect identification procedure like the one presented in this paper.
   In fact, one of the main results of this study consists in determining
   the distribution of normal (peeling) stresses throughout the
   adhesive-to-concrete interface. This stress component (Mode I) can
   neither be directly measured during the tests nor determined by the
   theoretical models usually adopted for simulating the fracturing
   behavior of FRP-to-concrete joints in the so-called fracture process in
   ``mode II{''}. Finally, it was found that the shear stresses are
   significantly higher than the peeling ones and control the crack
   propagation process. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, a model based on fuzzy logic (FL) for predicting

   in both crack divider and crack arrester configurations has been
   presented. Functionally graded steels containing graded ferritic and
   austenitic regions together with bainite and martensite intermediate
   layers were produced by electroslag remelting. For purpose of building
   the model, training and testing using experimental results from 140
   specimens produced from two basic composites were conducted. The used
   data as inputs in FL models are arranged in a format of six input
   parameters that cover the FGS type, the crack tip configuration, the
   thickness of graded ferritic region, the thickness of graded austenitic
   region, the distance of the notch from bainite or martensite
   intermediate layer, and temperature. According to these input
   parameters, in the FL, the ductile to brittle transition temperature of
   each FGS specimen was predicted. It has been found that FL model will be
