Abstract = {{A study on the accuracy of cohesive models for capturing dynamic
   fragmentation of ceramic microstructures is presented. The investigation
   consists of a combined experimental/numerical approach in which
   microcracking and damage kinetics are examined by means of plate impact
   recovery experiments. The numerical analysis is based on a 2-D
   micromechanical stochastic finite element analysis. The model
   incorporates a cohesive law to capture microcrack initiation,
   propagation and coalescence, as well as crack interaction and branching,
   as a natural outcome of the calculated material response. The
   stochasticity of the microfracture process is modeled by introducing a
   Weibull distribution of interfacial strength at grain boundaries. This
   model accounts for randomness in grain orientation, and the existence of
   chemical impurities and glassy phase at grain boundaries. Representative
   volume elements (RVE) of ceramic microstructure with different grain
   size and shape distributions are considered to account for features
   observed in real microstructures. Normal plate impact velocity histories
   are used not only to identify model parameters, but also to determine
   under what conditions the model captures failure mechanisms
   experimentally observed. The analyses show that in order to capture
   damage kinetics a particular distribution of grain boundary strength and
   detailed modeling of grain morphology are required. Simulated microcrack
   patterns and velocity histories have been found to be in a good
   agreement with the experimental observations only when the right grain
   morphology and model parameters are chosen. It has been found that the
   addition of rate effects to the cohesive model results in microcrack
   diffusion not observed experimentally. (C) 2001 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{This paper describes the utilization of Electro-Mechanical (E/M)
   impedance method for structural health monitoring of thin plates. The
   method allows the direct identification of structural dynamics by
   obtaining its E/M impedance or admittance signatures. The analytical
   model for two-dimensional structure was developed and verified with
   experiments. Good matching of experimental results and calculated
   spectra was obtained for axial and flexural components. The ability of
   the method to identify the presence of damage was investigated by
   performing an experiment where the damage in the form of crack was
   simulated with an EDM slit placed at various distances from the sensor.
   It was found that the crack presence dramatically modifies the E/M
   impedance spectrum and this modification decreases as the distance
   between the sensor and the crack increases. Several overall-statistics
   damage metrics, which may be used for on-line structural heath
   monitoring, were investigated. Among these candidate damage metrics, the
   alphath power of the correlation coefficient deviation, CCDalpha, 3 <
   \&alpha; < 7, used in the high frequency band 300-450 kHz, was found to
   be most successful. Careful selection of the high frequency band and
   proper choice of the appropriate damage metric were found to be
   essential for successful damage detection and structural health

Abstract = {{Objective: To compare the histopathologic changes in the human
   trabecular meshwork (TM) after argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) and
   selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) with a Q-switched,
   frequency-doubled, neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser.
   Design: Human ``in vitro{''} experimental study.
   Tissue and Controls: Eight human autopsy eyes were obtained within 18
   hours of death from persons aged 71 to 78 years.
   Methods: The anterior segment of autopsy eyes was isolated, and one half
   of each trabecular meshwork underwent SLT and the other half ALT,
   Specimens were evaluated with scanning and transmission electron
   microscopy.
   Main Outcome Measures: Structural changes in the TM were detected by
   scanning electron microscopy, and cellular or intracellular changes were
   seen with transmission electron microscopy.
   Results: Evaluation of the TM after ALT revealed crater formation in the
   uveal meshwork at the junction of the pigmented and nonpigmented TM,
   Coagulative damage was evident at the base and along the edge of
   craters, with disruption of the collagen beams, fibrinous exudate, lysis
   of endothelial cells, and nuclear and cytoplasmic debris. Evaluation of
   the TM after SLT revealed no evidence of coagulative damage or
   disruption of the corneoscleral or uveal trabecular beam structure,
   Minimal evidence of mechanical damage was present after SLT, and the
   only ultrastructural evidence of laser tissue interaction was cracking
   of intracytoplasmic pigment granules and disruption of trabecular
   endothelial cells.
   Conclusions: SLT applied ``in vitro{''} to the TM of human eye bank eyes
   seemed to cause no coagulative damage and less structural damage to the
   human TM when compared with ALT and, therefore, may be a safer and more
   repeatable procedure. (C) 2001 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.}},

Abstract = {{We report results of hydrothermal experiments on four alluvial zircons
   from Sri Lanka, which cover a wide range of radiation damage, at 450
   degreesC and 1.3 kbar for 744 h with 2 M CaCl2 solution as reactive
   fluid. After the hydrothermal treatment, the most metamict samples show
   micrometer-thick reaction rims, which surround apparently unreacted
   zircon, as revealed by cathodoluminescence (CL) and Nomarski
   differential interference contrast (NDIC) images. These rims have sharp,
   curved, and transgressive boundaries with unreacted zircon and are, in
   some cases, spread out along cracks. The thickness of reaction rims
   increases with increasing cumulated cn-dosage of the starting materials.
   The reaction rims are strongly enriched in Ca (up to 7000 ppm) and a
   water species and depleted in radiogenic Pb, Zr, and Si, as revealed by
   electron microprobe analyses. A significant Th loss from the reaction
   rims was detected in the case of the most metamict sample, whereas U
   remained in the structure. FT-infrared spectrometry and X-ray
   diffraction measurements revealed that the bulk run products were
   recrystallized. Using micro-Raman spectrometry, we were able to
   demonstrate that differential recrystallization took place. The reaction
   rims are strongly recrystallized, whereas the unreacted grain interiors
   underwent only minor recrystallization. Recrystallization of the rims is
   accompanied by an enhancement of the integral CL intensity. It is
   suggested that recrystallization in the reaction rims was catalyzed by
   water infiltration and ion exchange and prevented significant congruent
   zircon dissolution under the given experimental conditions. Previous
   zircon studies have shown that (1) a transgressive morphology, (2) a
   reduced Th-U ratio, and (3) an enhanced CL emission are also
   characteristics of rims in zircons from high-grade metamorphic rocks.
   Based on these similarities between natural and experimentally produced
   rims, it is suggested that leaching-catalyzed recrystallization is an
   important alteration process in zircon under wet geological conditions
   and can account for many complex core-rim structures found in natural
   zircons. Furthermore, the strong enrichment of Ca in the reaction rims
   supports previous assumptions that high Ca concentrations in natural
   zircons are of secondary origin. It is suggested that lower U-Pb
   concordia intercept ages obtained from single-phase zircons with high Ca
   contents date a leaching event.}},

Abstract = {{The friction and wear characteristics of nanometer ZnO filled
   polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) composite blocks with different filler
   proportions in sliding against stainless steel rin g under dry friction
   condition were studied. The microstructures, worn surfaces and transfer
   films of PTFE and nanometer ZnO/PTFE composite were then examined with
   scanning electron microscope (SEM). Experimental results show that
   filling nanometer ZnO to PTFE could greatly reduce the wear of this
   polymer and the best anti-wear property was obtained with the composite
   containing 15 vol.\% nanometer ZnO. In comparison with pure PTFE, the
   friction property of these composites was maintained. With the increase
   of load and sliding velocity, the coefficient of friction of nanometer
   ZnO/PTFE composites was reduced and the anti-wear ability of them was
   not very damaged. It was seen from the cross-section micrographs of PTFE
   and nanometer ZnO/PTFE composite that the fiber structures that existed
   in pure PTFE were disappeaxed by filling nanometer ZnO into PTFE. This
   indicated that this filler could prevent the destruction of PTFE banded
   structures during friction process. SEM pictures of the transfer films
   indicated that with the frictional couple of stainless steel
   ring/composite block filled with 15 vol.\% nanometer ZnO, a uniform and
   tenacious transfer film was formed on the ring surface, which promised
   an excellent anti-wear property of this composite. SEM examination of 15
   vol.\% nanometer ZnO/PTFE composite also showed that some cracks on the
   worn surface of the composite appeared during sliding under 300 N. The
   creation and development of the cracks led to deterioration of the wear
   property of this composite under higher load. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The fatigue damage analysis is examined from a historical perspective.
   The analysis indicates that some of the issues concerning the basic
   disparities between the experiment and model/interpretations. To help
   understand these issues, we have developed an approach with two driving
   force parameters to analyze the fatigue behavior. Such an approach helps
   in viewing the damage in terms of an intrinsic problem rather than an
   extrinsic one. In the final analysis one needs to unify the overall
   damage processes such that the description is complete from the crack
   initiation stage to short crack to long crack to final failure. In order
   to unify the damage process, three basic parameters are introduced for
   describing the overall fatigue process. These are DeltaK, K-max and
   internal stress contribution to K-max. In addition, there are other
   effects from environment and temperature that can contribute to these
   parameters. In particular K-max seems to play an important role in the
   overall damage process. We find that the internal stress is the missing
   link that can bridge the gap between the four main stages of damage that
   lies between the crack nucleation stage to final failure. Examples are
   sited in support of this view of explanation, Finally, it is suggested
   that systematic experimental data and analytical modeling to describe
   the internal stress gradients is required to help in forming a reliable

Abstract = {{Brittle failure limits the compressive strength of rock and ice when
   rapidly loaded under low to moderate confinement. Higher confinement or
   slower loading results in ductile failure once the brittle-ductile
   transition is crossed. Brittle failure begins when primary cracks
   initiate and slide, creating wing cracks at their tips(1-3). Under
   little to no confinement, wing cracks extend and link together,
   splitting the material into slender columns which then fail. Under low
   to moderate confinement, wing crack growth is restricted and terminal
   failure is controlled by the localization of damage along a narrow band.
   Early investigations proposed that localization results from either the
   linkage of wing cracks(1-3) or the buckling of microcolumns created
   between adjacent wing cracks(4,5). Observations of compressive failure
   in ice(6) suggest a mechanism whereby localization initiates owing to
   the bending-induced failure of slender microcolumns created between sets
   of secondary cracks emanating from one side of a primary crack. Here we
   analyse this mechanism, and show that it leads to a closed-form,
   quantitative model that depends only on independently measurable
   mechanical parameters. Our model predictions for both the brittle
   compressive strength and the brittle-ductile transition are consistent
   with data from a variety of crystalline materials, offering quantitative
   evidence for universal processes in brittle failure and for the broad
   applicability of the model.}},

Abstract = {{Closed-form expressions for the thermo-elastic properties of
   {[}S/90(n)](s) laminates with transverse cracks in the 90 degrees layers
   are derived. Provided the normalised average crack-opening displacement
   (COD) is known, expressions contain only crack density, geometrical
   parameters and elastic constants of layers. The average COD dependence
   on the crack spacing and constraint effect of adjacent sub-laminates is
   analysed by using finite-element method in plane stress formulation. It
   is found that the out-of-plane elastic constants have an insignificant
   effect on GOD. A simple power law relating average COD to elastic and
   geometrical parameters of constituents is derived. The obtained power
   law and the developed methodology are successfully used to predict the
   reduction of thermo-elastic properties and damage evolution of {[}+/-
   theta /90(4)](s) laminates. The crack-closure technique and Monte-Carlo
   simulations are used to model the damage development. The 90 degrees
   layer is divided in to a large number of elements and G(c) values are
   assigned to each element according to a Weibull distribution. Parameters
   in the Weibull distribution are determined by using experimental crack
   density versus strain curve for glass-fibre/epoxy {[}0(2)/90(4)](s)
   cross-ply laminates. Damage development in {[}S/90(4)](s) laminates of
   the same material, containing sub-laminates with +/- theta layers only,
   is modelled by using these Weibull parameters and the results are in
   good agreement with test data. The effect of the thickness of the 90
   degrees layer on damage development is discussed in strength and
   fracture mechanics formulation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All
