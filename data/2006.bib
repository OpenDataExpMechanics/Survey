Abstract = {{Disorder and long-range interactions are two of the key components that
   make material failure an interesting playfield for the application of
   statistical mechanics. The cornerstone in this respect has been lattice
   models of the fracture in which a network of elastic beams, bonds, or
   electrical fuses with random failure thresholds are subject to an
   increasing external load. These models describe on a qualitative level
   the failure processes of real, brittle, or quasi-brittle materials. This
   has been particularly important in solving the classical engineering
   problems of material strength: the size dependence of maximum stress and
   its sample-to-sample statistical fluctuations. At the same time, lattice
   models pose many new fundamental questions in statistical physics, such
   as the relation between fracture and phase transitions. Experimental
   results point out to the existence of an intriguing crackling noise in
   the acoustic emission and of self-affine fractals in the crack surface
   morphology. Recent advances in computer power have enabled considerable
   progress in the understanding of such models. Among these partly still
   controversial issues, are the scaling and size-effects in material
   strength and accumulated damage, the statistics of avalanches or bursts
   of microfailures, and the morphology of the crack surface. Here we
   present an overview of the results obtained with lattice models for
   fracture, highlighting the relations with statistical physics theories
   and more conventional fracture mechanics approaches.}},

   criterion is proposed to assure that the formulation can account for
   changes in the loading mode in a thermodynamically consistent way. The
   formulation accounts for crack closure effects to avoid interfacial
   penetration of two adjacent layers after complete decohesion. The model
   is implemented in a finite element formulation, and the numerical
   predictions are compared with experimental results obtained in both
   composite test specimens and structural components. (C) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The life of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) is currently
   limited by the mechanical endurance of polymer electrolyte membranes and
   membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs). In this paper, the authors report
   recent experimental and modeling work toward understanding the
   mechanisms of delayed mechanical failures of polymer electrolyte
   membranes and MEAs under relevant PEMFC operating conditions. Mechanical
   breach of membranes/MEAs in the form of pinholes and tears has been
   frequently observed after long-term or accelerated testing of PEMFC
   cells/stacks. Catastrophic failure of cell/stack due to rapid gas
   crossover shortly follows the mechanical breach. Ex situ mechanical
   characterizations were performed on MEAs after being subjected to the
   accelerated chemical aging and relative humidity (RH) cycling tests. The
   results showed significant reduction of MEA ductility manifested as
   drastically reduced strain-to-failure of the chemically aged and
   RH-cycled MEAs. Postmortem analysis revealed the formation and growth of
   mechanical defects such as cracks and crazing in the membranes and MEAs.
   A finite element model was used to estimate stress/strain states of an
   edge-constrained MEA under rapid RH variations. Damage metrics for
   accelerated testing and life prediction of PEMFCs are discussed. (c)

Abstract = {{This paper presents a feasibility study for practical applications of an

   (Lead-Zirconate-Titanate) patches to concrete structures. First,
   comparison between experimental and analytical studies for damage

   progressive surface damage inflicted artificially on the plain concrete
   beam is assessed by using both lateral and thickness modes of the PZT
   patches. Then, an analytical study based on finite element (FE) models
   is carried out to verify the validity of the experimental result.
   Secondly, multiple (shear and flexural) cracks incurred in a reinforced
   concrete (RC) beam under a third point bending test are monitored
   continuously by using a sensor array system composed of the PZT patches.
   In this study, a root mean square deviation (RMSD) in the impedance
   signatures of the PZT patches is used as a damage indicator.}},

Abstract = {{The fracture strength of Si is considered in the context of yield and
   reliability of microelectronic and microelectromechanical (MEMS)
   devices. An overview of Si fracture, including the strength of Si
   wafers, dice and MEMS elements, highlights the importance of
   understanding sharp contact flaws, with their attendant residual stress
   fields, lateral cracks and strength-limiting half-penny cracks in
   advanced Si device manufacturing, Techniques using controlled
   indentation flaws, including measurements of hardness, crack lengths,
   crack propagation under applied stress, and inert and reactive
   strengths, are applied in an extensive new experimental study of
   intrinsic, n- and p-type \{100\} and \{110\} Si single crystals and
   polycrystalline Si, addressing many of the issues discussed in the
   overview. The new results are directly applicable in interpreting the
   strengths of ground or diced Si wafer surfaces and provide a foundation
   for studying the strengths of MEMS elements, for which the
   strength-controlling flaws are less well-defined. Although the
   indentation fracture behavior of Si is shown to be quite anisotropic,
   the extensive lateral cracking greatly affects crack lengths and
   strengths, obscuring the underlying single crystal fracture anisotropy.
   No effects of doping on fracture are observed. Strength decreases in
   water and air suggest that Si is susceptible to reactive attack by
   moisture, although the effect is mild and extremely rapid. Strength
   increases of indented components after buffered HF etching are shown to
   be due to reactive attack of the contact impression, leading to residual
   stress relief. (c) 2006 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Systematic investigations of fatigue damage and dislocation structures
   in thin Cu films with different thicknesses (0.2-3.0 mu m) and grain
   sizes (0.3-2.1 mu m mean diameter) were carried out using focused ion
   beam microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The morphologies
   of fatigue-induced extrusions, cracks, and dislocation structures were
   studied and found to be controlled by film thickness and grain size.
   When either of these length scales is decreased below roughly 1 mu m,
   the typical dislocation wall and cell structures found in fatigued
   coarse-grained bulk materials no longer develop and are replaced by
   individual dislocations. Similarly, the typical surface damage of
   fatigued bulk metals, such as extrusions and cracks near extrusions, is
   gradually suppressed and replaced by damage that is localized at
   interfaces, such as cracks, grooves, and voids along grain and twin
   boundaries. This gradual transition from damage characteristic of bulk
   metals to damage localized at interfaces is attributed to constraints on
   dislocation activity at submicrometer length scales. Based on the
   experimental results and a theoretical analysis of extrusion formation,
   a mechanistic map of fatigue damage behavior is proposed that summarizes
   this length scale dependence. (c) 2006 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new methodology to predict the onset of damage,
   final failure and failure mode of mechanically fastened joints in

   point or average stress models. Standardized procedures to measure the
   characteristic distances used in the point or average stress models are
   proposed. The methodology proposed is applicable in double-shear joints
   using quasi-isotropic laminates. The predictions are compared with
   experimental data obtained in pin- and bolt-loaded joints, and the
   results indicate that the methodology proposed can accurately and

   velocity impact should be clearly understood. In the present study,
   investigations on the ballistic impact behaviour of two-dimensional
   woven fabric composites have been presented. Ballistic impact is
   generally a low-mass high velocity impact caused by a propelling source.
   The analytical method presented is based on wave theory. Different
   damage and energy absorbing mechanisms during ballistic impact have been
   identified. These are: cone formation on the back face of the target,
   tension in primary yarns, deformation of secondary yarns, delamination,
   matrix cracking, shear plugging and friction during penetration.
   Analytical formulation has been presented for each energy absorbing
   mechanism. Energy absorbed during each time interval and the
   corresponding reduction in velocity of the projectile has been
   determined. The solution is based on the target material properties at
   high strain rate and the geometry and the projectile parameters. Using
   the analytical formulation, ballistic limit, contact duration at
   ballistic limit, surface radius of the cone formed and the radius of the
   damaged zone have been predicted for typical woven fabric composites.
   The analytical predictions have been compared with the experimental
   results. A good correlation has been observed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of experimental studies on piezoelectric
   lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT)-based active damage detection techniques
   for nondestructive evaluations (NDE) of steel bridge components. PZT
   patches offer special features suitable for real-time in situ health
   monitoring systems for large and complex steel structures, because they
   are small, light, cheap, and useful as built-in sensor systems. Both
   impedance and Lamb wave methods are considered for damage detection of
   lab-size steel bridge members. Several damage-sensitive features are
   extracted: root mean square deviations (RMSD) in the impedances and
   wavelet coefficients (WC) of Lamb waves, and the times of flight (TOF)
   of Lamb waves. Advanced signal processing and pattern recognition
   techniques such as continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and support vector
   machine (SVM) are used in the current system. Firstly, PZT patches were
   used in conjunction with the impedance and Lamb waves to detect the
   presence and growth of artificial cracks on a 1/8 scale model for a
   vertical truss member of Seongsu Bridge, Seoul, Korea, which collapsed
   in 1994. The RMSD in the impedances and WC of Lamb waves were found to
   be good damage indicators. Secondly, two PZT patches were used to detect
   damage on a bolt-jointed steel plate, which was simulated by removing
   bolts. The correlation of the Lamb wave transmission data with the
   damage classified by in and out of the wave path was investigated by
   using the TOF and WC obtained from the Lamb wave signals. The SVM was
   implemented to enhance the damage identification capability of the
   current system. The results from the experiments showed the validity of
   the proposed methods.}},

Title = {{Time-lapsed investigation of three-dimensional failure and damage
   accumulation in trabecular bone using synchrotron light}},

Abstract = {{Synchrotron radiation micro-computed tomography (SR mu CT) is a very
   useful technique when it comes to three-dimensional (3D) imaging of
   complex internal and external geometries. Being a fully non-destructive
   technique, SR mu CT can be combined with other experiments in situ for
   functional imaging. We are especially interested in the combination of
   SR mu CT with mechanical testing in order to gain new insights in the
   failure mechanism of trabecular bone. This interest is motivated by the
   immense costs in health care due to patients suffering from
   osteoporosis, a systemic skeletal disease resulting in decreased bone
   stability and increased fracture risk. To better investigate the
   different failure mechanisms on the microlevel, we have developed a
   novel in situ mechanical compression device, capable of exerting both
   static and dynamic displacements on experimental samples. The device was
   calibrated for mechanical testing using solid aluminum and bovine
   trabecular bone samples. To study different failure mechanisms in
   trabecular bone, we compared a fatigued and a non-fatigued bovine bone
   sample with respect to failure initiation and propagation. The fatigued
   sample failed in a burst-like fashion in contrast to the non-fatigued
   sample, which exhibited a distinct localized failure band. Moreover,
   microscopic cracks - microcracks and microfractures - were uncovered in
   a 3D fashion illustrating the failure process in great detail. The
   majority of these cracks were connected to a bone surface. The data also
   showed that the classification of microcracks and -fractures from 2D
   section can sometimes be ambiguous, which is also true for the
   distinction of diffuse and distinct microdamage. Detailed investigation
   of the failure mechanism in these samples illustrated that trabecular
   bone often fails in delamination, providing a mechanism for energy
   dissipation while conserving trabecular bone architecture. In the
   future, this will allow an even better understanding of bone mechanics
   related to its hierarchical structural organization. (c) 2006 Elsevier
