Abstract = {{Cost-effective and reliable damage detection is critical for the
   utilization of composite materials. This paper presents part of an
   experimental and analytical survey of candidate methods for in situ
   damage detection of composite materials. Experimental results are
   presented for the application of Lamb wave techniques to quasi-isotropic
   graphite/epoxy test specimens containing representative damage modes,
   including delamination, transverse ply cracks and through-holes. Linear
   wave scans were performed on narrow laminated specimens and sandwich
   beams with various cores by monitoring the transmitted waves with
   piezoceramic sensors. Optimal actuator and sensor configurations were
   devised through experimentation, and various types of driving signal
   were explored. These experiments provided a procedure capable of easily
   and accurately determining the time of flight of a Lamb wave pulse
   between an actuator and sensor. Lamb wave techniques provide more
   information about damage presence and severity than previously tested
   methods (frequency response techniques), and provide the possibility of
   determining damage location due to their local response nature. These
   methods may prove suitable for structural health monitoring applications
   since the travel long distances and can be applied with conformable
   piezoelectric actuators and sensors that require little power.

Abstract = {{Piezoelectric wafer active sensors may be applied on aging aircraft
   structures to monitor the onset and progress of structural damage such
   as fatigue cracks and corrosion. The state of the art in
   piezoelectric-wafer active sensors structural health monitoring and
   damage detection is reviewed. Methods based on (a) elastic wave
   propagation and (b) the Electro-Mechanical (E/M) impedance technique are
   cited and briefly discussed. For health monitoring of aging aircraft
   structures, two main detection strategies are considered: the E/M
   impedance method for near field damage detection, and wave propagation
   methods for far-field damage detection. These methods are developed and
   verified on simple-geometry specimens and on realistic aging aircraft
   panels with seeded cracks and corrosion. The experimental methods,
   signal processing, and damage detection algorithms are tuned to the
   specific method used for structural interrogation. In the E/M impedance
   method approach, the high-frequency spectrum, representative of the
   structural resonances, is recorded. Then, overall-statistics damage
   metrics can be used to compare the impedance signatures and correlate
   the change in these signatures with the damage progression and
   intensity. In our experiments, the (1 - R-2)(3) damage metric was found
   to best fit the results in the 300-450 kHz band. In the wave propagation
   approach, the pulse-echo and acousto-ultrasonic methods can be utilized
   to identify the additional reflections generated from crack damage and
   the changes in transmission phase and velocity associated with corrosion
   damage. The paper ends with a conceptual design of a structural health
   monitoring system and suggestions for aging aircraft installation
   utilizing active-sensor arrays, data concentrators, wireless
   transmission, and a health monitoring and processing unit.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study of the confined compression behavior of concrete
   has been performed using 150 X 300 mm cylindrical specimens subjected to
   hydrostatic pressure in a triaxial cell and axial loading through a
   servo-hydraulic testing machine. A confining stress range of 0 to 60 MPa
   (about twice the uniaxial compressive strength) was employed to obtain
   the brittle-ductile transition behavior of the material. The increase in
   confining pressure leads to a change in the mode of failure and an
   increase in the maximum axial load-carrying capacity. It is seen that,
   at zero or low confinement, there is distributed microcracking and
   several macrocracks, and the response exhibits a well-defined peak and
   subsequent softening. At high confinements, relatively large axial and
   transversal strains of over 10\% have been obtained, with monotonically
   increasing loads leading to horizontal plateaus, There is no distributed
   cracking and failure occurs with the propagation of few macrocracks. In
   general, the observed trends confirm and extend previous results
   reported in the literature. Optical microscopy shows extensive
   microcracking, especially in the aggregates, and pore collapse at high
   confinement. A preliminary interpretation of the results based on the
   theory of elastoplasticity is also presented.}},

Abstract = {{The use of changes in dynamic system characteristics to detect damage
   has received considerable attention during the last years. This paper
   presents experimental results obtained within the framework of the
   development of a health monitoring system for civil engineering
   structures, based on the changes of dynamic characteristics. As a part
   of this research, reinforced concrete beams of 6 meters length are
   subjected to progressing cracking introduced in different steps. The
   damaged sections are located in symmetrical or asymmetrical positions
   according to the beam tested. The damage assessment consists in relating
   the changes observed in the dynamic characteristics and the level of the
   crack damage introduced in the beams.
   It appears from this analysis that eigenfrequencies are affected by
   accumulation of cracks in the beams and that their evolutions are not
   influenced by the crack damage locations; they decrease with the crack
   damage accumulation. The MAC factors are less sensitive to crack damage
   compared to eigenfrequencies, but give an indication of the symmetrical
   or asymmetrical nature of the induced crack damage. Next to this, the
   COMAC factors, the strain energy evolution and the changes in
   flexibility matrices are also examined as to their capability for
   detection and location of damage in the RC beams, the strain energy
   method appears to be more precise than the others. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A mechanistic model of impact attrition of particulate solids, having a

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method for estimating high-cycle fatigue strength
   under multiaxial loading conditions. The physical interpretation of the
   fatigue damage is based on the theory of cyclic deformation in single
   crystals. Such a theory is also used to single out those stress
   components which can be considered significant for crack nucleation and
   growth in the so-called Stage I regime. Fatigue life estimates are
   carried out by means of a modified Wohler curve which can be applied to
   both smooth and blunt notched components, subjected to either in-phase
   or out-of-phase loads. The modified Wohler curve plots the fatigue
   strength in terms of the maximum macroscopic shear stress amplitudes,
   the reference plane - where such amplitudes have to be evaluated - being
   thought of as coincident with the fatigue microcrack initiation plane.
   The position of the fatigue strength curve also depends on the stress
   component normal to such a plane and the phase angle as well. About 450
   experimental data taken from the literature are used to check the
   accuracy of the method under multiaxial fatigue conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Guided Lamb waves can be used for a fast inspection of large areas, e.g.
   the detection of cracks at rivet holes in the fuselage of airplanes.
   When the guided wave hits a discontinuity like a hole, a typical
   scattered displacement field is obtained. A change of the scattered
   field indicates the development of a crack. In the experiments, the
   first anti-symmetric mode A(0) of Lamb waves in plates is excited
   selectively by means of a piezoelectric transducer. The used frequency
   range is below the cut-off frequencies of higher wave modes. The
   scattered field around undamaged and damaged holes is measured on a grid
   around the hole with a heterodyne laser interferometer. Two types of
   damage are introduced: a notch cut with a very fine saw blade, and a
   fatigue grown crack. A significant change in the scattered field due to
   the defect is seen. Good agreement of the experimental results with
   theoretical calculations is obtained, The wave propagation is studied
   using Mindlin's theory of plates. The scattered field is calculated
   analytically and using finite difference methods (FDMs). (C) 2002

Abstract = {{A mesh-free Galerkin simulation of dynamic shear band propagation in an
   impact-loaded pre-notched plate is carried out in both two and three
   dimensions. The related experimental work was initially reported by
   Kalthoff and Winkler (1987), and later re-examined by Zhou et al.
   (1996a,b), and others.
   The main contributions of this numerical simulation are as follows: (1)
   The ductile-to-brittle failure mode transition is observed in numerical
   simulations for the first time; (2) the experimentally observed dynamic
   shear band, whose character changes with an increase of impact velocity,
   propagating along curved paths is replicated; (3) the simulation is able
   to capture the details of the adiabatic shear band to a point where the
   periodic temperature profile inside shear band at mum scale can clearly
   be seen; (4) an intense, high strain rate region is observed in front of
   the shear band tip, which, we believe, is caused by wave trapping at the
   shear band tip; it in turn causes damage and stress collapse inside the
   shear band and provides a key link for self-sustained instability. (C)

Abstract = {{Radial cracking has been identified as the primary mode of failure in
   all-ceramic crowns. This study investigates the hypothesis that critical
   loads for radial cracking in crown-like layers vary explicitly as the
   square of ceramic layer thickness. Experimental data from tests with
   spherical indenters on model flat laminates of selected dental ceramics
   bonded to clear polycarbonate bases (simulating crown/dentin structures)
   are presented. Damage initiation events are video-recorded in situ
   during applied loading, and critical loads are measured. The results
   demonstrate an increase in the resistance to radial cracking for
   zirconia relative to alumina and for alumina relative to porcelain. The
   study provides simple a priori predictions of failure in prospective
   ceramic/substrate bilayers and ranks ceramic materials for best clinical
   performance.}},

Title = {{On the use of embedded discontinuity elements with crack path continuity

Abstract = {{In this paper, strong discontinuities embedded in finite elements are
   used to model discrete cracking in quasi-brittle materials. Special
   attention is paid to (i) the constitutive models used to describe the
   localized behaviour of the discontinuities, (ii) the enforcement of the
   continuity of the crack path and (iii) mixed-mode crack propagation.
   Different constitutive relations are adopted to describe the localized
   behaviour of the discontinuities, namely two damage laws and one
   plasticity law. A numerical algorithm is introduced to enforce the
   continuity of the crack path. In the examples studied, an objective
   dissipation of energy with respect to the mesh is found. Examples of
   mode-I and mixed-mode crack propagation are presented, namely a double
   notch tensile test and a single-edge notched beam subjected to shear. In
   the former case different crack patterns are obtained depending on the
   notch offset, in the latter case special emphasis is given to the effect
   of shear on the global structural response. In particular, both the peak
   load and the softening response of the structure are related to the
   amount of shear tractions allowed to develop between crack faces. The
   results obtained are compared to experimental results. As a general
   conclusion, it is found that crack path continuity allows for the
   development of crack patterns similar to those found in experiments,
   even when reasonably coarse meshes are used. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science
