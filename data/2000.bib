Abstract = {{The first part of this two-part study presents a new improved microplane
   constitutive model for concrete, representing the fourth Version in the
   Line of microplane models developed at Northwestern University. The
   constitutive law is characterized as a relation between the normal,
   volumetric, deviatoric, and shear stresses and strains on planes of
   various orientations, called the microplanes. The strain components on
   the microplanes are the projections of the continuum strain tensor, and
   the continuum stresses are obtained from the microplane stress
   components according to the principle of virtual work. The improvements
   include (I) a work-conjugate volumetric deviatoric split-the main
   improvement, facilitating physical interpretation of stress components;
   (2) additional horizontal boundaries (yield limits) for the normal and
   deviatoric microplane stress components, making it possible to control
   the curvature at the peaks of stress-strain curves; (3) an improved
   nonlinear frictional yield surface with plasticity asymptote; (4) a
   simpler and more effective fitting procedure with sequential
   identification of material parameters; (5) a method to control the
   steepness and tail length of postpeak softening: and (6) damage modeling
   with a reduction of unloading stiffness and crack-closing boundary. The
   second part of this study, by Caner and Bazant, will present an
   algorithm for implementing the model in structural analysis programs and
   provide experimental verification and calibration by test data.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with gear condition monitoring based on vibration
   analysis techniques. The detection and diagnostic capability of some of
   the most effective techniques are discussed and compared on the basis of
   experimental results, concerning a gear pair affected by a fatigue
   crack. Tn particular, the results of new approaches based on
   time-frequency and cyclostationarity analysis are compared against those
   obtained by means of the well-accepted cepstrum analysis and
   time-synchronous average analysis. Moreover, the sensitivity to fault
   severity is assessed by considering two different depths of the crack.
   The effect of transducer location and processing options are also shown.
   In the case of the experimental results considered in this paper, the
   power cepstrum is practically insensitive to the crack evolution.
   Conversely, the spectral correlation density function is able to monitor
   the fault development and dos not seem to be significantly influenced by
   the transducer position. Analysis techniques of the time-synchronous
   average, such as this `residual' signal and the demodulation technique,
   are able to localise the damaged tooth; however, the sensitivity of the
   demodulation technique is strongly dependent on the proper choice of the
   filtering band and affected by the transducer location. The wavelet
   transform seems to be a good tool for crack detection: it is
   particularly effective if the residual part of the time-synchronous
   averaged signal is processed. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Marbles as building stones as well as in their natural environments show
   complex weathering phenomena. The most important damage scenario is
   based on the highly anisotropic thermal expansion coefficient cu of
   calcite, i.e. extreme expansion parallel and contraction normal to the
   crystallographic c-axis. Therefore, the rock fabric and especially the
   lattice-preferred orientation (texture) of calcite and/or dolomite as
   the predominant mineral phases in marbles have a significant influence
   on the mechanical weathering. The textures of marbles from five
   different locations vary from a more or less perfect prolate to moderate
   oblate shape of the {[}006] pole figure tensor. Accordingly, the
   texture-derived bulk thermal dilatation anisotropy covers a broad range
   from -0.048 to 0.680. The modelled thermal dilatations correlate with
   those obtained from experimental measurements. The difference in
   magnitude is basically explained by the microcrack fabrics which was not
   considered in the computations. All samples show a deterioration due to
   thermal treatment regardless of the strength of texture. The directional
   dependence of (a) the total magnitude of the thermal dilatation
   coefficient and (b) of the residual strain is highest in marbles with a
   strong texture, whereas the Carrara marble with a weak texture exhibits
   a uniform crack formation. The progressive loss of cohesion along grain
   boundaries due to dilatancy may serve as an example for the initial
   stage of physical weathering.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of traversing cracks on the steady-state diffusion
   properties of concrete was studied. The effect of both anisotropic and
   isotropic crack networks was first theoretically assessed using an
   analytical approach. To simplify the transport equations, cracks were
   assumed to be of uniform size and evenly distributed on a one- or
   two-dimensional grid. Results of the theoretical analysis were then
   compared to experimental data. Both series of results indicate that
   cracking can markedly alter the diffusion properties of the material and
   favor the penetration (or the leaching) of drifting species. A simple
   method to predict the effect of cracking on the concrete diffusivity is
   proposed. Predictions are made on the basis of two parameters: the crack
   density and the mean crack aperture. This method can provide a first
   estimate of the diffusion properties of severely damaged concrete

Abstract = {{Damage detection in vibrating beams, or beam systems, is dealt with in
   this paper. Damage is represented by a more or less concentrated

   that damage is frequently concentrated in a few zones, albeit unknown,
   so that only the modification in the characteristics of a few sections
   or elements needs to be determined. Attention is focused on the basic
   aspects of the problem, by discussing the amount of frequencies
   necessary to locate and quantify the damage uniquely. Two different
   procedures of damage identification are used, which mainly take
   advantage of the peculiar characteristics of the problem. Cases with
   pseudoexperimental and experimental frequencies are solved. A
   generalization of the procedure based on finite-element models, which
   makes possible the tackling complex structural cases, is illustrated and

Abstract = {{This study presents the results of an experimental investigation

   Impact tests were conducted to characterize the type and extent of the
   damage observed in a variety of sandwich configurations with
   graphite/epoxy face sheets and foam or honeycomb cores. Correlation of
   the residual indentation and cross-sectional views of the impacted
   specimens provide a criterion for the extent of the damage. In the
   foam-core samples, significant damage was found to be present for
   residual indentations over 0.13 mm. Although the high-density foam-core
   and thicker face sheet increased the amount of energy required to
   generate damage, the damage was still similar for similar levels of
   residual indentation. For the honeycomb samples, 0.25 nun of residual
   indentation indicated significant levels of internal damage. However,
   the surfaces of both the honeycomb and foam samples revealed very little
   damage at these levels of impact energy. As the impact energy was
   increased, the samples experienced one of two types of damage: a tear or
   crack from the center of the laminate to the edge, or significant damage
   consisting of a dent localized in the region of impact. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Both fretting wear and fretting fatigue suffer from particle detachment
   and cracking induced damage. Wear induced by fretting is related to a
   three-stage phenomenon: (1) accommodation of the displacement in the
   upper layers of the two counterbodies; (2) detachment of particles from
   material with a modified or transformed structure; and (3) third-body
   behaviour, i.e. accommodation of the velocity in the powder bed.
   The specific transformed structure from which debris is made is called
   the tribologically transformed structure or TTS. TTS has been shown to
   form in the first accommodation stage within a very few initial fretting
   cycles. Understanding of its formation and degradation are required to
   control and predict wear generated by fretting. Extensive studies
   focussed on the nature of TTSs depending on several metallic contacts
   (steels, aluminium alloys, alpha-, beta-, or alpha + beta -titanium
   alloys,...) and different testing conditions (load, sliding amplitude,
   number of cycles, environment). Powerful analytical tools were utilized
   to determine the TTS composition and structure. TTS appeared as a
   nanocrystalline structure, corresponding to the chemical composition of
   the initial material and made of the more stable structure in accordance
   with the equilibrium diagram. No specific effects of oxygen or hydrogen
   was detected. In the present article, experimental results will be
   discussed to point out possible mechanisms of the formation of the TTS.
   An analogy with butterflies which form under rolling fatigue will be
   outlined. At last, an energy approach to explain formation will be
   presented for the case of low-alloy steel. It is demonstrated that TTS
   formation is related to a critical cumulative plastic deformation
   associated with a specific threshold dissipated energy. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{This paper describes the localization of deformation acceleration in the
   period prior to dynamic failure in hornblende schist rock under triaxial
   compression using acoustic emission (AE) monitoring. Rather than
   stabilize the failure process by controlling axial stress to maintain a
   constant rate of AE (for monitoring AE hypocenters) as in previous works
   {[}e.g., Lockner et al., 1991], we have instead developed a rapid
   multichannel data collection system. This enables us to elucidate the
   dynamics of fault nucleation under condition of constant stress (creep)
   loading, which is a better approximation to low strain rate condition in
   the Earth and allows both quasi-static and dynamic crack growth to
   occur. The waveforms of more than 8000 AE events which occurred mainly
   during a 15 s period were recorded on 32 channels, with a sampling rate
   of 50 ns and mask time of 200 mu s. Hypocentral locations of AE sources
   revealed that the fault initiated at one end of the core and then
   propagated into the unfaulted rock with a process zone (fault front) of
   intense cracking. We found that there were two different processes
   operating during the quasi-static nucleation of a shear fault, namely a
   process zone in front of the fault tip and a ``wake{''} of damage zone
   following the process zone. The process zone had the following features:
   (1) major tensile cracking, (2) low b value and fewer larger events, and
   (3) strong self-excitation. The mechanism of crack interaction and fault
   growth was, therefore, a mutual enhancement` on dilatation due to
   tensile cracking, On the other hand, the damage zone was characterized
   by (1) major shear cracking, (2) low b value and more larger events, and
   (3) weak self-excitation, indicating that in the damage zone, following
   the development of a shear fault, linkage between cracks became the
   major mechanism of crack interaction and fault development. The mutual
   changes of b value and self-exciting strength observed in our
   experiments seem to occur as a result of the hierarchy of fault growth,
   which was not observed under slowed down loading conditions. Therefore
   our experimental results, under a realistic approximation of the dynamic
   condition of the Earth, are meaningful for the problems of earthquakes
   as well as rock bursts.}},
