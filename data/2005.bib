Abstract = {{The capability of embedded piezoelectric wafer active sensors (PWAS) to
   excite and detect tuned Lamb waves for structural health monitoring is
   explored. First, a brief review of Lamb waves theory is presented.
   Second, the PWAS operating principles and their structural coupling
   through a thin adhesive layer are analyzed. Then, a model of the Lamb
   waves tuning mechanism with PWAS transducers is described. The model
   uses the space domain Fourier transform. The analysis is performed in
   the wavenumber space. The inverse Fourier transform is used to return
   into the physical space. The integrals are evaluated with the residues
   theorem. A general solution is obtained for a generic expression of the
   interface shear stress distribution. The general solution is reduced to
   a closed-form expression for the case of ideal bonding which admits a
   closed-form Fourier transform of the interfacial shear stress. It is
   shown that the strain wave response varies like sin gamma alpha, whereas
   the displacement response varies like sinc gamma alpha. Maximum coupling
   is achieved when the PWAS length equals the half wavelength of a
   particular Lamb wave mode. Since Lamb wave modes wavelengths vary with
   frequency, the tuning of certain modes at certain frequencies can thus
   be achieved. Tuning curves are derived and verified against experimental
   results. A particular S-0 mode `sweet spot' is found at 300 kHz for a
   7-mm PWAS attached to a 1.6-min aluminum plate. Crack detection via the
   pulse echo technique using the phased array principle and tuned So mode
   Lamb waves is demonstrated as an effective structural health monitoring
   method.}},

Abstract = {{A model for fatigue crack growth (FCG) analysis based on the
   elastic-plastic crack tip stress-strain history was proposed. The
   fatigue crack growth was predicted by simulating the stress-strain
   response in the material volume adjacent to the crack tip and estimating
   the accumulated fatigue damage. The fatigue crack growth was regarded as
   a process of successive crack re-initiation in the crack tip region. The
   model was developed to predict the effect of the mean stress including
   the influence of the applied compressive stress. A fatigue crack growth
   expression was derived using both the plane strain and plane stress
   state assumption. It was found that the FCG was controlled by a two
   parameter driving force in the form of: Delta K = K-max(p),(tot)Delta
   K-tot((1-p)). The driving force was derived on the basis of the local
   stresses and strains at the crack tip using the Smith-Watson-Topper
   (SWT) fatigue damage parameter: D=sigma(max)Delta epsilon/2.The effect
   of the internal (residual) stress induced by the reversed cyclic
   plasticity was accounted for the subsequent analysis. Experimental
   fatigue crack growth data sets for two aluminum alloys (7075-T6 and
   2024-T351) and one steel alloy (4340) were used for the verification of
   the model. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Micromechanical models for fracture initiation that incorporate local
   failure criteria have been widely developed for metallic and ceramic
   materials; however, few such micromechanical models have been developed
   for the fracture of bone. In fact, although the fracture event in
   ``hard{''} mineralized tissues such as bone is commonly believed to be
   locally strain-controlled, only recently has there been experimental
   evidence (using double-notched four-point bend testing) to support this
   widely held belief. In the present study, we seek to shed further light
   on the nature of the local cracking events that precede catastrophic
   fracture in human cortical bone, and to define their relationship to the
   microstructure. Specifically, numerical computations are reported that
   demonstrate that the stress and strain states ahead of such a notch are
   qualitatively similar irrespective of the deformation mechanism
   (pressure-insensitive plasticity vs. pressure-sensitive microcracking).
   Furthermore, we use the double-notched test to examine
   crack-microstructure interactions from a perspective of determining the
   salient toughening mechanisms in bone and to characterize how these may
   affect the anisotropy in fracture properties. Based on preliminary
   micromechanical models of these processes, the relative contributions of
   various toughening mechanisms are established. In particular, crack
   deflection and uncracked-ligament bridging are identified as the major
   mechanisms of toughening in cortical bone. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Corrosion of embedded reinforcement is the most prevalent form of
   degradation of reinforced concrete structures, and may impair structural
   capacity through loss of bar section, loss of bond between reinforcement
   and concrete as a result of longitudinal cracking, or loss of concrete
   cross section. The effect of corrosion attack on mechanical properties
   of reinforcement is investigated through physical tests on bars with
   simulated and real corrosion damage and through a simple numerical
   model. Bars subjected to local or pitting attack may suffer a relatively
   modest loss of strength but a significant loss of ductility, and this is
   related principally to the variability of attack along the length of the
   bar The numerical model supplements experimental work through a
   parametric study on the influence of steel characteristics. Finally,
   guidelines on assessment are suggested that are derived from results
   reported in the paper and from elsewhere in the published literature.}},

Abstract = {{Osteonal bone is often compared to a composite material and to metals as
   discontinuities within the material may provide sites of stress
   concentration for crack initiation and serve as barriers to crack
   growth. However, little experimental data exist to back up these
   hypotheses. Fluorescent chelating agents were applied at specific
   intervals to bone specimens fatigue tested in cyclic compression at a
   stress range of 80 MPa. The failed specimens were sectioned and labelled
   microcracks identified using UV epifluorescence microscopy. Microcrack
   lengths were measured and their relationship to cement lines Surrounding
   secondary osteons recorded. Microcrack length at the time of
   encountering a cement line was also measured. Microcracks of less than
   100 mu m stopped growing when they encountered a cement line.
   Microcracks of greater than 100 mu m in length continued to grow after
   encountering a cement line surrounding an osteon. Only microcracks
   greater than 300 mu m in length were capable of penetrating osteons and
   these microcracks were the only ones which were observed to cause
   failure in the specimen. These experimental data support the hypothesis
   that secondary osteons act as barriers to crack propagation in compact
   bone. However, it shows that this microstructural barrier effect is
   dependent on the crack length at the time of encountering an osteon. For
   the vast majority of cracks, osteons act as barriers to growth but for
   the minority of cracks that are long enough and do break through the
   cement line, an osteon may actually act as a weakness in the bone and
   facilitate crack propagation. (c) 2004 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Abstract = {{The experimental investigations described in this paper were conducted
   in order to study the strength and failure of mechanically fastened

   Fiber Reinforced Plastic laminates were selected to evaluate the effect

   using a non-contact electro-optical extensometer to measure hole
   elongation is proposed. During static tensile testing, the response of
   bearing damage was monitored by acoustic emission measurement. Several
   specimens were observed by means of soft X-ray radiography and SEM at
   different loading levels to assess internal damage. The observations
   indicate that the bearing failure can be outlined as a process of
   compressive damage accumulation, and can be divided into the following
   four stages: damage onset; damage growth; local fracture; structural
   fracture. Major features of bearing failure include fiber
   micro-buckling, matrix cracking, delamination and out-of-plane shear
   cracking. Bearing strength and failure mode should also depend on the

Abstract = {{Concrete is a quasi-brittle material, where tensile failure involves
   progressive micro-cracking, debounding and other complex irreversible
   processes of internal damage. Strain-softening is a dominate feature and
   advanced numerical schemes have to be applied in order to circumvent the
   ill-posdness of the Boundary-Value Problem to deal with. Throughout the
   paper we pursue the cohesive zone approach, where initialization and
   coalescence of micro-cracks is lumped into the cohesive fracture process
   zone in terms of accumulation of damage. We develop and employ a
   (discrete) constitutive description of the cohesive zone, which is based
   on a transversely isotropic traction separation law. The model reflects
   an exponential decreasing traction with respect to evolving opening
   displacement and is based on the theory of invariants. Non-negativeness
   of the damage dissipation is proven and the associated numerical
   embedded representation is based on the Partition of Unity Finite
   Element Method. A consistent linearization of the method is presented,
   where particular attention is paid to the (cohesive) traction terms.
   Based on the proposed concept three numerical examples are studied in
   detail, i.e. a double-notched specimen under tensile loading, a four
   point shear test and a pull-out test of unreinforced concrete. The
   computational results show mesh-independency and good correlation with
   experimental results. \&COPY; 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a coupled constitutive model is proposed for anisotropic
   damage and permeability variation in brittle rocks under deviatoric
   compressive stresses. The formulation of the model is based on
   experimental evidences and main physical mechanisms involved in the
   scale of microcracks are taken into account. The proposed model is
   expressed in the macroscopic framework and can be easily implemented for
   engineering application. The macroscopic free enthalpy of cracked solid
   is first determined by approximating crack distribution by a
   second-order damage tensor. The effective elastic properties of damaged
   material are then derived from the free enthalpy function. The damage
   evolution is related to the crack growth in multiple orientations. A
   pragmatic approach inspired from fracture mechanics is used for the
   formulation of the crack propagation criterion. Compressive stress
   induced crack opening is taken into account and leads to macroscopic
   volumetric dilatancy and permeability variation. The overall
   permeability tensor of cracked material is determined using a
   micro-macro averaging procedure. Darcy's law is used for fluid flow at
   the macroscopic scale whereas laminar flow is assumed at the microcrack
   scale. Hydraulic connectivity of cracks increases with crack growth. The
   proposed model is applied to the Lac du Bonnet granite. Generally, good
   agreement is observed between numerical simulations and experimental

Abstract = {{Fatigue damage requires to be expressed in terms of a crack. This will
   be revealed by several items of experimental evidence. First,
   observations on a medium carbon steel that relate to the initiation
   zones and the propagation of small cracks subjected to low cycle
   fatigue, will be presented; these observations being based on surface
   replica studies. It will be shown that the Coffin-Manson high-strain,
   low-cycle, fatigue relationship is substantially the same as a crack
   growth law. Second, the effect of prior fatigue history on the growth
   rate of a small crack is investigated systematically using special
   specimens containing an artificial small hole of various diameters, i.e.
   40, 100 and 200 Pm. Prior fatigue history is shown to have little
   influence on the crack growth rate in the high-strain fatigue regime.
   Third, it will be revealed that the loss of fracture ductility after
   strain cycling in high-strain fatigue tests is attributable to the
   existence of small surface cracks. The loss of fracture ductility
   depends on the crack length l. If I is larger than a critical length
   1(c), the fatigue crack causes macroscopic shear fracture in a tensile
   test following strain cycling. On the other hand, if I is smaller than
   1(c), the tensile fracture surfaces are of the cup-and-cone type. For
   70/30 brass, 1(c) is about 400 mu m. Thus, fatigue damage models which
   ignore the reality of fatigue damage as expressed in terms of cracks
   should not be used for fatigue life predictions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In order to select high erosion resistant materials or to estimate
   erosion damage caused by solid particle impact in actual cases, it is
   very important to take the mechanical properties of a material into
   account. It is well known that material hardness is closely related to
   erosion damage to materials. Another mechanical property apart from
   material hardness should be investigated, since the material hardness is
   not necessarily an essential indicator for industrially useful
   materials. From the fact that material removal is caused by indentation
   processes, material hardness is clearly one of the predominant
   parameter. It is also proposed that a new mechanical property directly
   associated with erosion damage exists in the indentation phenomenon. In
   quasi-static indentation tests using a WC ball, load relaxation after
   the completion of the indentation was measured and characterized for
   aluminum, copper, carbon steel and stainless steel specimens. It was
   found that the degree of load relaxation depended upon the ability of
   plastic flow for soft materials and upon brittleness accompanied by
   intergranular cracks between composite phases for hard metallic
   materials. It was concluded that a predictive equation containing both
   material hardness and the load relaxation ratio could be related to
   estimate experimental erosion damage data for many types of materials
   under a variety of impact conditions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A model for assessing wear and rolling contact fatigue (RCF) in rails is
   proposed, with particular emphasis for their competitive role.
   RCF was studied taking into account different mechanisms of crack
   nucleation and propagation in different working conditions, and failure
   indexes are proposed to predict which damage mechanism prevails.
   Wear was investigated in terms of wear rate under different working
   conditions; a method to compare it to crack propagation rate is proposed
   in order to predict if wear can remove surface cracks due to RCF.
   The effectiveness of the method was verified by experimental tests. (C)
