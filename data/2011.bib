Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to review existing literature in the area
   of nano-modification of asphalt and proceed to apply nano-materials to
   asphalt to improve the performance. This study integrates literature
   review, preparation, and characterization of nano-modified asphalt
   materials. In the experimental testing montmorillonite, nanoclay at 2\%
   and 4\% by weight of asphalt was blended in asphalt binder at a high
   temperature to exfoliate the nanoclay within the asphalt. The asphalt
   binder was then characterized using the Superpave (TM) rotational
   viscosity, dynamic shear modulus, and direct tension test. The
   rotational viscosity results indicate that the addition of the two types
   of nanoclay, Nanoclay A and Nanoclay 8, increased the rotational
   viscosity by an average of 41\% and 112\%, respectively, across test
   temperatures 80, 100, 130, 135, 150 and 175 degrees C. It was found that
   the dynamic shear complex modulus (G{*}) value increases significantly
   across a range of testing temperatures (from 13 to 70 degrees C) and
   loading frequencies (0.01-25 Hz). With 2\% Nanoclay A reinforcement in
   the asphalt binder, the complex shear moduli generally increased by 66\%
   while the 4\% Nanoclay A reinforcement in the asphalt binder generally
   increased the shear complex moduli by 125\%. The 2\% and 4\% Nanoclay B
   increased the shear complex moduli by 184\% and 196\%, respectively. In
   terms of direct tension strength, the use of Nanoclay A and Nanoclay B
   reduced the strain failure rate of the original binder while the secant
   or direct tension moduli showed increase with the addition of the
   nanoclays. In furtherance of this research, nanoclay-modified asphalt is
   being tested at percentages higher than 4\% to underscore the fact that
   nanoclays may have the potential to reduce rutting and cracking. (C)

Abstract = {{Time-dependent brittle deformation is a fundamental and pervasive
   process operating in the Earth's upper crust. Its characterization is a
   pre-requisite to understanding and unraveling the complexities of
   crustal evolution and dynamics. The preferential chemical interaction
   between pore fluids and strained atomic bonds at crack tips, a mechanism
   known as stress corrosion, allows rock to fail under a constant stress
   that is well below its short-term strength over an extended period of
   time: a process known as brittle creep. Here we present the first
   experimental measurements of brittle creep in a basic igneous rock (a
   basalt from Mt. Etna volcano) under triaxial stress conditions. Results
   from conventional creep experiments show that creep strain rates are
   highly dependent on the level of applied stress (and can be equally well
   fit by a power law or an exponential law): with a 20\% increase in
   stress producing close to three orders of magnitude increase in creep
   strain rate. Results from stress-stepping creep experiments show that
   creep strain rates are also influenced by the imposed effective
   confining pressure. We show that only part of this change can be
   attributed to the purely mechanical influence of an increase in
   effective pressure, with the remainder interpreted as due to a reduction
   in stress corrosion reactions; the result of a reduction in crack
   aperture that restricts the rate of transport of reactive species to
   crack tips. Overall, our results also suggest that a critical level of
   crack damage is required before the deformation starts to accelerate to
   failure, regardless of the level of applied stress and the time taken to
   reach this point. The experimental results are discussed in terms of
   microstructural observations and fits to a macroscopic creep law, and
   compared with the observed deformation history at Mt. Etna volcano. (c)

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{59}},

Abstract = {{New extensions of a model for the growth and coalescence of ellipsoidal
   voids based on the Gurson formalism are proposed in order to treat
   problems involving shear and/or voids axis not necessarily aligned with
   the main loading direction, under plane strain loading conditions. These
   extensions are motivated and validated using 3D finite element void cell
   calculations with overall plane strain enforced in one direction. The
   starting point is the Gologanu model dealing with spheroidal void shape.
   A void rotation law based on homogenization theory is coupled to this
   damage model. The predictions of the model closely agree with the 3D
   cell calculations, capturing the effect of the initial void shape and
   orientation on the void rotation rate. An empirical correction is also
   introduced for the change of the void aspect ratio in the plane
   transverse to the main axis of the void departing from its initially
   circular shape. This correction is needed for an accurate prediction of
   the onset of coalescence. Next, a new approach is proposed to take
   strain hardening into account within the Thomason criterion for internal
   necking, avoiding the use of strain hardening-dependent fitting
   parameters. The coalescence criterion is generalized to any possible
   direction of the coalescence plane and void orientation. Finally, the
   model is supplemented by a mathematical description of the final drop of
   the stress carrying capacity during coalescence. The entire model is
   developed for plane strain conditions, setting the path to a 3D
   extension. After validation of the model, a parametric study addresses
   the effect of shear on the ductility of metallic alloys for a range of
   microstructural and flow parameters, under different stress states. In
   general, the presence of shear, for identical stress triaxiality,
   decreases the ductility, partly explaining recent experimental results
   obtained in the low stress triaxiality regime. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Uniaxial compression experiments were performed for brittle sandstone
   samples containing a single fissure by a rock mechanics servo-controlled
   testing system. Based on the experimental results of axial stress-axial
   strain curves, the influence of single fissure geometry on the strength
   and deformation behavior of sandstone samples is analyzed in detail.
   Compared with the intact sandstone sample, the sandstone samples
   containing a single fissure show the localization deformation failure.
   The uniaxial compressive strength, Young's modulus and peak axial strain
   of sandstone samples with pre-existing single fissure are all lower than
   that of intact sandstone sample, which is closely related to the fissure
   length and fissure angle. The crack coalescence was observed and
   characterized from tips of pre-existing single fissure in brittle
   sandstone sample. Nine different crack types are identified based on
   their geometry and crack propagation mechanism (tensile, shear, lateral
   crack, far-field crack and surface spalling) for single fissure, which
   can be used to analyze the failure mode and cracking process of
   sandstone sample containing a single fissure under uniaxial compression.
   To confirm the subsequence of crack coalescence in sandstone sample, the
   photographic monitoring and acoustic emission (AE) technique were
   adopted for uniaxial compression test. The real-time crack coalescence
   process of sandstone containing a single fissure was recorded during the
   whole loading. In the end, the influence of the crack coalescence on the
   strength and deformation failure behavior of brittle sandstone sample
   containing a single fissure is analyzed under uniaxial compression. The
   present research is helpful to understand the failure behavior and
   fracture mechanism of engineering rock mass (such as slope instability
   and underground rock burst).}},

   To investigate the brittle failure characteristics of the Opalinus Clay
   recovered from the Mont Terri Underground Research Laboratory, a series
   of 19 unconfined uniaxial compression tests were performed utilizing
   servo-controlled testing procedures. All specimens were tested at their
   natural water content with loading approximately normal to the bedding.
   Acoustic emission (AE) measurements were utilized to help quantify
   stress levels associated with crack initiation and propagation. The
   unconfined compression strength of the tested specimens averaged 6.9
   MPa. The crack initiation threshold occurred at approximately 30\% of
   the rupture stress based on analyzing both the acoustic emission
   measurements and the stress-strain behavior. The crack damage threshold
   showed large variability and occurred at approximately 70\% of the
   rupture stress.}},

Abstract = {{The initiation and evolution of transverse matrix cracks and
   delaminations are predicted within a mesh-independent cracking (MIC)
   framework. MIC is a regularized extended finite element method (x-FEM)
   that allows the insertion of cracks in directions that are independent
   of the mesh orientation. The Heaviside step function that is typically
   used to introduce a displacement discontinuity across a crack surface is
   replaced by a continuous function approximated by using the original
   displacement shape functions. Such regularization allows the
   preservation of the Gaussian integration schema regardless of the
   enrichment required to model cracking in an arbitrary direction. The
   interaction between plies is anchored on the integration point
   distribution, which remains constant through the entire simulation.
   Initiation and propagation of delaminations between plies as well as
   intra-ply MIC opening is implemented by using a mixed-mode cohesive
   formulation in a fully three-dimensional model that includes residual
   thermal stresses. The validity of the proposed methodology was tested
   against a variety of problems ranging from simple evolution of
   delamination from existing transverse cracks to strength predictions of
   complex laminates without a priori knowledge of damage location or
   initiation. Good agreement with conventional numerical solutions and/or
   experimental data was observed in all the problems considered. Published
   2011. This article is a US Government work and is in the public domain

Abstract = {{In this paper we focus on the external sulfate attack on concrete
   specimens at the meso-level. There is nowadays a renewed interest in
   rationally describing the mechanisms behind expansive processes leading
   to cracking and spalling of concrete exposed to sulfate solutions. A
   model is presented for degradation of concrete exposed to external
   sulfate attack at the meso-level, i.e. representing explicitly in the
   simulations the main heterogeneities of the material. A previously
   developed mesomechanical approach has been coupled with a
   diffusion-reaction analysis at the same scale. It is based on the
   systematic use of zero-thickness interface elements equipped with
   fracture-based constitutive laws, and the effect of discrete cracks on
   the transport of ions is explicitly accounted for. The main results
   obtained agree qualitatively and quantitatively well with experimental
   observations in terms of ettringite penetration depth, expansions, crack
   patterns and spalling effects. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Experimental studies are reported for crack detection of a beam
   structure under a static displacement with the spatial wavelet
   transform. An invisible perturbation in the deflection profile of the
   beam at the crack position due to its existence would be induced. Such a
   small perturbation will be discerned or amplified through a wavelet
   transform such that a detection of crack location becomes possible
   practically. To realize this, the static profile of a cracked cantilever
   aluminum beam subjected to a static displacement at its free end is
   analyzed with Gabor wavelet to identify the crack. The damage detection
   of the beam with different crack depths is conducted. The spatial
   wavelet transform is proven to be effective in identifying the damage
   area even when the crack depth is around 26\% of the thickness of the
   beam. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},
