Abstract = {{In this paper, a comprehensive methodology for locating and determining
   the extent of linear cracks in homogeneous plates based on the
   time-of-flight analysis of Lamb wave propagation is proposed.
   Piezoelectric sensors and actuators (PZTs) placed on a square grid
   configuration are used to excite and receive direct and reflected waves.
   The actuation frequency, spacing of PZTs and length of the signal to
   analyze are first determined. The grid is used to sweep across the plate
   to identify the location of a crack, if there is one. Elliptical loci of
   possible crack positions are constructed based on the flight time of
   crack-reflected waves estimated using energy spectra from the
   Hilbert-Huang transform of the sensor signals. A detailed procedure for
   obtaining the ellipses is described, including the blind zones. After
   identifying the crack position, the crack orientation is determined by
   varying the positions of the PZTs and observing the strength of the
   energy peaks in the Hilbert spectra. This provides the basis for moving
   the PZTs to estimate the extent of the crack. Experimental results
   obtained using aluminum plates with through, half-through and concealed
   cracks showed that the proposed method is feasible and accurate.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental method to determine the stress-elongation relation for a
   thin adhesive layer loaded in peel is presented. The method is based on
   equilibrium of the energetic forces acting on a DCB-specimen. These
   energetic forces are identified to be associated with the geometrical
   positions of the acting loads and the start of the adhesive layer. The
   first energetic force is shown to be given by the product of the force
   and the rotation of the loading point. The second energetic force is
   shown to be given by the area under the stress-elongation curve for the
   adhesive layer. Using equilibrium of these energetic forces, the shape
   of the stress-elongation curve is determined. A test set-up is developed
   to facilitate the experiments. Special consideration is given to the
   accuracy of the measurement of the elongation of the adhesive. Results
   from two sets of experiments with slightly varying geometry are
   presented. The main result is that the stress-elongation relation can be
   described by a curve divided into three parts; initially the stress
   increases proportionally to the elongation. This corresponds to a linear
   elastic behaviour of the layer. The next part is given by a constant
   limiting stress. The curve ends with a parabolically softening part.
   After this point, a crack has been initiated in the adhesive. The
   experimental results are first compared to an asymptotic analysis using
   linear elastic fracture mechanics. This shows that the new method to
   evaluate the fracture energy gives consistent results. The experiments
   are also simulated using the measured stress-elongation law. Good
   agreement with the experiments is achieved which further validates the
   method. The fracture energy and the maximum peel stress are found to
   agree well within each set of experiments. Some variation is found
   between the two sets. This is accredited to differences in fracture
   initiation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All. rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{41}},

Pages = {{833-847}},

Abstract = {{The rock mass failure process is characterized by several distinct
   deformation stages which include crack initiation, crack propagation and
   coalescence. It is important to know the stress levels associated with
   these deformation stages for engineering design and practice.
   Extensive theoretical, experimental and numerical studies on the failure
   process of intact rocks exist. It is generally understood that crack
   initiation starts at 0.3 to 0.5 times the peak uniaxial compressive
   stress. In confined conditions, the constant-deviatoric stress criterion
   was found to describe the crack initiation stress level.
   Here, generalized crack initiation and crack damage thresholds of rock
   masses are proposed. The crack initiation threshold is defined by
   sigma(1) - sigma(3) = A sigma(cm) and the crack damage threshold is
   defined by sigma(1) - sigma(3) = B sigma(cm) for jointed rock masses,
   where A and B are material constants and sigma(cm) is the uniaxial
   compressive strength of the rock masses. For a massive rock mass without
   joints, sigma(cm) is equal to sigma(cd), the long-term uniaxial strength
   of intact rock. After examining data from intact rocks and jointed rock
   masses, it was found that for massive to moderately jointed rock masses,
   the material constants A and B are in the range of 0.4 to 0.5, 0.8 to
   0.9, respectively, and for moderately to highly jointed rock masses, A
   and B are in the range of 0.5 to 0.6, 0.9 to 1.0, respectively. The
   generalized crack initiation and crack damage thresholds, when combined
   with simple linear elastic stress analysis, assist in assessing the rock
   mass integrity in low confinement conditions, greatly reducing the
   effort needed to obtain the required material constants for engineering
   design of underground excavations. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{Two major mechanisms that could potentially be responsible for
   toughening in mineralized tissues, such as bone and dentin, have been
   identified-microcracking and crack bridging. While evidence has been
   reported for both mechanisms, there has been no consensus thus far on
   which mechanism plays the dominant role in toughening these materials.
   In the present study, we seek to present definitive experimental
   evidence supporting crack bridging, rather than microcracking, as the
   most significant mechanism of toughening in cortical bone and dentin. In
   vitro fracture toughness experiments were conducted to measure the
   variation of the fracture resistance with crack extension
   {[}resistance-curve (R-curve) behavior] for both materials with special
   attention paid to changes in the sample compliance. Because these two
   toughening mechanisms induce opposite effects on the sample compliance,
   such experiments allow for the definitive determination of the dominant
   toughening mechanism, which in the present study was found to be crack
   bridging for microstructurally large crack sizes. The results of this
   work are of relevance from the perspective of developing a
   micromechanistic framework for understanding fracture behavior of
   mineralized tissue and in predicting failure in vivo. (C) 2004 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The World-Wide Failure Exercise (WWFE) contained a detailed assessment
   of 19 theoretical approaches for predicting the deformation and failure
   response of polymer composite laminates when subjected to complex states
   of stress. The leading five theories are explored in greater detail to
   demonstrate their strengths and weaknesses in predicting various types
   of structural failure. Recommendations are then derived, as to how the
   theories can be best utilised to provide safe and economic predictions
   in a wide range of engineering design applications. Further guidance is
   provided for designers on the level of confidence and bounds of
   applicability of the current theories. The need for careful
   interpretation of initial failure predictions is emphasised, as is the
   need to allow for multiple sources of non-linearity (including
   progressive damage) where accuracy is sought for certain classes of
   large deformation and final failure strength predictions. Aspects
   requiring further experimental and theoretical investigation are
   identified. Direction is also provided to the research community by
   highlighting specific, tightly focussed, experimental and theoretical
   studies that, if carried out in the very near future, would pay great
   dividends from the designer's perspective, by increasing their
   confidence in the theoretical foundations. (C) 2003 QinetiQ Ltd.

Abstract = {{Results from a systematic study of damage in material structures

   made on model flat-layer specimens fabricated from various dental
   ceramic combinations bonded to dentin-like polymer substrates, in
   bilayer (ceramic/polymer) and trilayer (ceramic/ceramic/polymer)
   configurations. The specimens are loaded at their top surfaces with
   spherical indenters, in simulation of occlusal function. The onset of
   fracture is observed in situ using a video camera system mounted beneath
   the transparent polymer substrate. Critical loads to induce fracture and
   deformation at the ceramic top and bottom surfaces are measured as
   functions of layer thickness and contact duration. Radial cracking at
   the ceramic undersurface occurs at relatively low loads, especially in
   thinner layers. Fracture mechanics relations are used to confirm the
   experimental data trends, and to provide explicit dependencies of
   critical loads in terms of key variables: material-elastic modulus,
   hardness, strength and toughness: geometric-layer thicknesses and
   contact radius. Tougher, harder and (especially) stronger materials show
   superior damage resistance. Critical loads depend strongly
   (quadratically) on crown net thickness. The analytic relations provide a
   sound basis for the materials design of next-generation dental crowns.

Pages = {{25-56}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A micromechanical model is proposed to study the deformation and failure
   process of rock based on knowledge of heterogeneity of rock at the
   mesoscopic level. In this numerical model, the heterogeneity of rock at
   the mesoscopic level is considered by assuming the material properties
   in rock conform to the Weibull distribution. Elastic damage mechanics is
   used to describe the constitutive law of meso-level elements, the finite
   element method is employed as the basic stress analysis tool and the
   maximum tensile strain criterion as well as the Mohr-Coulomb criterion
   is utilized as the damage threshold. A simple method, similar to a
   smeared crack model, is used for tracing the crack propagation process
   and interaction of multiple cracks. Based on this model, a numerical
   simulation program named Rock Failure Process Analysis Code (RFPA) is
   developed. The influence of parameters that include the Weibull
   distribution parameters, constitutive parameters of meso-level elements
   and number of elements in the numerical model, are discussed in detail.
   It is shown that the homogeneity index is the most important factor to
   simulate material failure with this model. This model is able to capture
   the complete mechanical responses of rock, which includes the crack
   patterns associated with different loading stages and loading
   conditions, localization of deformation, stress redistribution and
   failure process. The numerical simulation of rock specimens under a
   variety of static loading conditions is presented, and the results
   compare well with experimental results.}},

   as fatigue cracks and corrosion. Two main detection strategies are
   considered: (a) the wave propagation method for far-field damage
   detection; and (b) the electro-mechanical (E/M) impedance method for
   near-field damage detection. These methods are developed and verified on
   simple-geometry specimens, and then tested on realistic aging-aircraft
   panels with seeded cracks and corrosion. The specimens instrumentation
   with piezoelectric-wafer active sensors and ancillary apparatus is
   presented. The experimental methods, signal processing, and damage
   detection algorithms, tuned to the specific method used for structural
   interrogation, are discussed. In the wave propagation approach, the
   pulse-echo and acousto-ultrasonic methods were considered. Reflections
   from seeded cracks were successfully recorded. In addition, acoustic
   emission and low-velocity impact were also detected. In the E/M
   impedance method approach, the high-frequency spectrum is processed
   using overall-statistics damage metrics. The (1-R(2))(3) damage metric,
   where R is the correlation coefficient, was found to yield the best
   results. The simultaneous use of the E/M impedance method in the near
   field and of the wave propagation method in the far field opens the way
   for a comprehensive multifunctional damage detection system for aging
   aircraft structural health monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Fine-pitch ball grid array (BGA) and underfills have been used in benign
   office environments and wireless applications for a number of years,
   however their reliability in automotive underhood environment is not
   well understood. In this work, the reliability of fine-pitch plastic
   ball grid array (PBGA) packages has been evaluated in the automotive
   underhood environment. Experimental studies indicate that the
   coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) as measured by thermomechanical
   analyzer (TMA) typically starts to change at 10-15 degreesC lower
   temperature than the T-g specified by differential scanning calorimetry
   (DSC) potentially extending the change in CTE well into the accelerated
   test envelope in the neighborhood of 125 degreesC. High T-g substrates
   with glass-transition temperatures much higher than the 125 degreesC
   high temperature limit, are therefore not subject to the effect of high
   coefficient of thermal expansion close to the high temperature of the
   accelerated test. Darveaux's damage relationships {[}1]-{[}3] were
   derived on ceramic ball grid array (CBGA) assemblies, with predominantly
   solder mask defined (SMD) pads and 62Sn36Pb2Ag solder. In addition to
   significant differences in the crack propagation paths for the two pad
   constructions, SMD pads fail significantly faster than the non solder
   mask defined (NSMD) pads in thermal fatigue. The thermal mismatch on
   CBGAs is much larger than PBGA assemblies. Crack propagation in CBGAs is
   often observed predominantly on the package side as opposed to both
   package and board side for PBGAs. In the present study, crack
   propagation data has been acquired on assemblies with 15, 17, and 23 mm
   size plastic BGAs with NSMD pads and 63Sn37Pb on high-T-g printed
   circuit boards. The data has been benchmarked against Darveaux's data on
   CBGA assemblies. Experimental matrix also encompasses the effect of
   bis-maleimide triazine (BT) substrate thickness on reliability. Damage
   constants have been developed and compared against existing Darveaux
   Constants. Prediction error has been quantified for both sets of
   constants.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of matrix elastoplastic properties and reinforcement volume
   fraction on damage initiation in model heterogeneous metals have been
   studied using in Situ tensile tests coupled with high resolution X-ray
   tomography. The materials consisted in two kinds of alurninium matrices
   (commercially pure Al and A12124 alloy) reinforced by 4 vol\% or 20
   vol\%,, of spherical hard ceramic particles. The main damage mechanisms
   were found to change from particle/matrix interface decohesion to
   particle cracking as the matrix got harder. Quantitative analyses of
   experimental observations have been performed using the three
   dimensional images. These measurements were linked to a Weibull
   statistic based on different local mechanical quantities (stress, strain
   or energy) calculated by Finite Element in the particle or at the
   particle/matrix interface. The results obtained for particle cracking
   confirmed that this damage mechanism is intrinsic to the chosen ceramic
   reinforcement and the theoretical approach allowed to determine
   mechanical parameters such as the particle critical stress. (C) 2004

Abstract = {{Chip types in machining are determined by the combined effects of
   workpiece material properties, cutting speed, and tool geometry. The
   understanding of chip formation plays an important role in machining
   process optimization and surface integrity. Discontinuous chips, one of
   the major chip types, are usually formed in hard machining at high
   speeds. In this study, a new method has been presented to simulate
   discontinuous chips in high-speed machining AISI 4340 (32 HRc). The
   workpiece material properties have been modeled using the Johnson-Cook
   (JC) plasticity model, and material crack formation and propagation
   simulated using the Johnson-Cook damage model. It has been shown that
   discontinuous chip is due to the internal crack initiation and
   propagation in front of the tool and above the cutting edge, rather than
   from the free surface. The simulated chip morphology correlated well
   with the experimental results. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights
