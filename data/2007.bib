Abstract = {{Mother-of-pearl, also known as nacre, is the iridescent material which
   forms the inner layer of seashells from gastropods and bivalves. It is
   mostly made of microscopic ceramic tablets densely packed and bonded
   together by a thin layer of biopolymer. The hierarchical microstructure
   of this biological material is the result of millions of years of
   evolution, and it is so well organized that its strength and toughness
   are far superior to the ceramic it is made of. In this work the
   structure of nacre is described over several length scales. The tablets
   were found to have wavy surfaces, which were observed and quantified
   using various experimental techniques. Tensile and shear tests performed
   on small samples revealed that nacre can withstand relatively large
   inelastic strains and exhibits strain hardening. In this article we
   argue that the inelastic mechanism responsible for this behavior is
   sliding of the tablets on one another accompanied by transverse
   expansion in the direction perpendicular to the tablet planes. Three
   dimensional representative volume elements, based on the identified
   nacre microstructure and incorporating cohesive elements with a
   constitutive response consistent with the interface material and
   nanoscale features were numerically analyzed. The simulations revealed
   that even in the absence of nanoscale hardening mechanism at the
   interfaces, the microscale waviness of the tablets could generate strain
   hardening, thereby spreading the inelastic deformation and suppressing
   damage localization leading to material instability. The formation of
   large regions of inelastic deformations around cracks and defects in
   nacre are believed to be an important contribution to its toughness. In
   addition, it was shown that the tablet junctions (vertical junctions
   between tablets) strengthen the microstructure but do not contribute to
   the overall material hardening. Statistical variations within the
   microstructure were found to be beneficial to hardening and to the
   overall mechanical stability of nacre. These results provide new
   insights into the microstructural features that make nacre tough and
   damage tolerant. Based on these findings, some design guidelines for
   composites mimicking nacre are proposed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Health monitoring of reinforced concrete bridges and other large-scale
   civil infrastructures has received considerable attention in recent
   years. However, traditional inspection methods (x-ray, C-scan, etc) are
   expensive and sometimes ineffective for large-scale structures.
   Piezoceramic transducers have emerged as new tools for the health
   monitoring of large-scale structures due to their advantages of active
   sensing, low cost, quick response, availability in different shapes, and
   simplicity for implementation. In this research, piezoceramic
   transducers are used for damage detection of a 6.1 m long reinforced
   concrete bridge bent-cap. Piezoceramic transducers are embedded in the
   concrete structure at pre-determined spatial locations prior to casting.
   This research can be considered as a continuation of an earlier work,
   where four piezoceramic transducers were embedded in planar locations
   near one end of the bent-cap. This research involves ten piezoceramic
   patches embedded at spatial locations in four different cross-sections.
   To induce cracks in the bent-cap, the structure is subjected to loads
   from four hydraulic actuators with capacities of 80 and 100 ton. In
   addition to the piezoceramic sensors, strain gages, LVDTs, and
   microscopes are used in the experiment to provide reference data. During
   the experiment, one embedded piezoceramic patch is used as an actuator
   to generate high frequency waves, and the other piezoceramic patches are
   used as sensors to detect the propagating waves. With the increasing
   number and severity of cracks, the magnitude of the sensor output
   decreases. Wavelet packet analysis is used to analyze the recorded
   sensor signals. A damage index is formed on the basis of the wavelet
   packet analysis. The experimental results show that the proposed methods
   of using piezoceramic transducers along with the damage index based on
   wavelet packet analysis are effective in identifying the existence and
   severity of cracks inside the concrete structure. The experimental
   results demonstrate that the proposed method has the ability to predict
   the failure of a concrete structure as verified by results from
   conventional microscopes (MSs) and LVDTs.}},

Abstract = {{A damage plasticity model for ductile fracture is proposed. This model
   is established on the cylindrical coordinate system of principal stress
   space. Experimental results show that fracture initiation in uncracked
   ductile solids is sensitive to the hydrostatic pressure and dependent on

   fracture envelope in principal stress space. Plastic deformation induced
   damage is calculated by an integral of the damage rate measured at
   current loading and deformation status with respect to the fracture
   envelope. A power law damage rule is proposed to characterize the
   nonlinearity in damage accumulation. A damage-related weakening factor
   is adopted to describe the material deterioration. The material
   parameters are calibrated from standard laboratory tests. The proposed
   model is numerically implemented. Four simulations with emphasis on
   crack path prediction are presented. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents a technique for the analysis of full wavefield data
   in the wavenumber/frequency domain as an effective tool for damage
   detection, visualization and characterization. Full wavefield data
   contain a wealth of information regarding the space and time variation
   of propagating waves in damaged structural components. Such information
   can be used to evaluate the response spectrum in the
   frequency/wavenumber domain, which effectively separates incident waves
   from reflections caused by discontinuities encountered along the wave
   paths. This allows removing the injected wave from the overall response
   through simple filtering strategies, thus highlighting the presence of
   reflections associated with damage. The concept is first illustrated on
   analytical and numerically simulated data, and then tested on
   experimental results. In the experiments, full wavefield measurements
   are conveniently obtained using a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer,
   which allows the detection of displacements and/or velocities over a
   user-defined grid, and it is able to provide the required spatial and
   time information in a timely manner. Tests performed on a simple
   aluminum plate with artificially seeded slits simulating longitudinal

Abstract = {{Nacre, also known as mother-of-pearl, is a hard biological composite
   found in the inside layer of many shells such as oyster or abalone. It
   is composed of microscopic ceramic tablets arranged in layers and
   tightly stacked to form a three-dimensional brick wall structure, where
   the mortar is a thin layer of biopolymers (20-30 nm). Although mostly
   made of a brittle ceramic, the structure of nacre is so well designed
   that its toughness is several order of magnitudes larger that the
   ceramic it is made of. How the microstructure of nacre controls its
   mechanical performance has been the focus of numerous studies over the
   past two decades, because such understanding may inspire novel composite
   designs though biomimetics. This paper presents in detail uniaxial
   tension experiment performed on miniature nacre specimens. Large
   inelastic deformations were observed in hydrated condition, which were
   explained by sliding of the tablets on one another and progressive
   locking generated by their microscopic waviness. Fracture experiments
   were also performed, and for the first time the full crack resistance
   curve was established for nacre. A rising resistance curve is an
   indication of the robustness and damage tolerance of that material.
   These measurements are then discussed and correlated with toughening
   extrinsic mechanisms operating at the microscale. Moreover, specific
   features of the microstructure and their relevance to associated
   toughening mechanisms were identified. These features and mechanisms,
   critical to the robustness of the shell, were finely tuned over millions
   of years of evolution. Hence, they are expected to serve as a basis to
   establish guidelines for the design of novel man-made composites.}},

Abstract = {{A spatially distributed array of single element piezoelectric
   transducers is considered for monitoring the integrity of plate-like
   structures over large areas. When these permanently attached transducers

   multiple modes as well as many boundary reflections. The complexity of
   the signals, including dispersive effects, can be reduced by digital
   bandpass filtering, and changes in these filtered signals over time can
   be monitored to detect and localize damage. Results are reported here
   from an experimental study whereby artificial damage was introduced in
   an aluminum plate in the form of through holes drilled at various
   locations. Time shift averaging algorithms were applied to differential
   signals filtered at multiple frequencies, resulting in many images for
   the same structural state, and these images were fused to improve damage
   localization and background noise. Individual and fused images were
   analyzed to quantify their ability to localize damage. The results show
   the efficacy of tile imaging method as well as the significant

Abstract = {{The equal-channel angular pressing of pure metals is conducted most
   expeditiously by pressing at room temperature using a die with a channel
   angle of 90 degrees. However, these conditions may lead to cracking of
   the billets or massive segmentation when applied to hard and
   difficult-to-work alloys. This paper uses finite element modeling to
   explore the procedures for successfully pressing these more complex
   materials. Separate models are developed using channel angles of 90
   degrees, 110 degrees and 135 degrees for materials having strain rate
   sensitivities of 0, 0.2 and 0.4. The calculations show that cracking and
   segmentation may be reduced or eliminated by increasing the strain rate
   sensitivity and/ or increasing the channel angle within the die. The
   magnitude of the imposed damage is evaluated for each condition using a

Abstract = {{A plastic-damage constitutive model for plain concrete is developed in
   this work. Anisotropic damage with a plasticity yield criterion and a
   damage criterion are introduced to be able to adequately describe the
   plastic and damage behavior of concrete. Moreover, in order to account
   for different effects under tensile and compressive loadings, two damage
   criteria are used: one for compression and a second for tension such
   that the total stress is decomposed into tensile and compressive
   components. Stiffness recovery caused by crack opening/closing is also
   incorporated. The strain equivalence hypothesis is used in deriving the
   constitutive equations such that the strains in the effective
   (undamaged) and damaged configurations are set equal. This leads to a
   decoupled algorithm for the effective stress computation and the damage
   evolution. It is also shown that the proposed constitutive relations
   comply with the laws of thermodynamics. A detailed numerical algorithm
   is coded using the user subroutine UMAT and then implemented in the
   advanced finite element program ABAQUS. The numerical simulations are
   shown for uniaxial and biaxial tension and compression. The results show
   very good correlation with the experimental data. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
