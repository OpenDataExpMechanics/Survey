Abstract = {{A reliable numerical damage model has been developed for adhesively
   bonded joints under fatigue loading that is only dependant on the
   adhesive system and not on joint configuration. A bi-linear
   traction-separation description of a cohesive zone model was employed to
   simulate progressive damage in the adhesively bonded joints.
   Furthermore, a strain-based fatigue damage model was integrated with the
   cohesive zone model to simulate the deleterious influence of the fatigue
   loading on the bonded joints. To obtain the damage model parameters and
   validate the methodology, carefully planned experimental tests on
   coupons cut from a bonded panel and separately manufactured single lap
   joints were undertaken. Various experimental techniques have been used
   to assess joint damage including the back-face strain technique and in
   situ video microscopy. It was found that the fatigue damage model was
   able to successfully predict the fatigue life and the evolving back-face
   strain and hence the evolving damage. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The interfacial fracture of adhesively bonded structures is a critical
   issue for the extensive applications to a variety of modern industries.
   In the recent two decades, cohesive zone models (CZMs) have been
   receiving intensive attentions for fracture problems of adhesively
   bonded joints. Numerous global tests have been conducted to measure the
   interfacial toughness of adhesive joints. Limited local tests have also
   been conducted to determine the interface traction-separation laws in
   adhesive joints. However, very few studies focused on the local test of
   effects of adhesive thickness on the interfacial traction-separation
   laws. Interfacial toughness and interfacial strength, as two critical
   parameters in an interfacial traction-separation law, have important
   effect on the fracture behaviors of bonded joints. In this work, the
   global and local tests are employed to investigate the effect of
   adhesive thickness on interfacial energy release rate, interfacial
   strength, and shapes of the interfacial traction-separation laws.
   Basically, the measured laws in this work reflect the equivalent and
   lumped interfacial fracture behaviors which include the cohesive
   fracture, damage and plasticity. The experimentally determined
   interfacial traction-separation laws may provide valuable baseline data
   for the parameter calibrations in numerical models. The current
   experimental results may also facilitate the understanding of adhesive
   thickness-dependent interface fracture of bonded joints. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{By extending molecular-dynamics simulation to the experimental
   micrometer length scale, we observed the complete dynamics of gold films
   subjected to ultrashort (less than or similar to 1 ps) laser
   irradiation, culminating in cavitation then ablation of the melt at the
   front, and crack nucleation then spallation at the rear side of the
   sample. For thick films (>0.5 mu m) ablation and spallation are
   spatially separated; whereas for thin films, they merge into a unique
   damage process, which leads to a dependence of ablation threshold on
   film thickness. This work provides insights into thermomechanical
   dynamics of irradiated metal films, including coupling-decoupling of
   ablation and spallation processes, and opens up a field of direct
   comparison between experiment and atomistic simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Statement of problem. Traditional testing of ceramic crowns creates a
   stress state and damage modes that differ greatly from those seen
   clinically. There is a need OD develop and communicate an in vitro
   testing protocol that is clinically valid.
   Purpose. The purpose of this study was to develop an in vitro failure
   test for ceramic single-unit prostheses that duplicates the failure
   mechanism and stress state observed in clinically failed prostheses.
   This article first compares characteristics of traditional
   load-to-failure tests of ceramic crowns with the growing body of
   evidence regarding failure origins and stress states at failure from the
   examination of clinically failed crowns, finite element analysis (FEA),
   and data from clinical studies. Based on this analysis, an experimental
   technique was systematically developed and test materials were
   identified to recreate key aspects of clinical failure in vitro.
   Material and methods. One potential dentin analog material (an epoxy
   filled with woven glass fibers; NEMA grade G10) was evaluated for
   elastic modulus in blunt contact and for bond strength to resin cement
   as compared to hydrated dentin. Two bases with different elastic moduli
   (nickel chrome and resin-based composite) were tested for influence on
   failure loads. The influence of water during storage and loading (both
   monotonic and cyclic) was examined. Loading piston materials (G10,
   aluminum, stainless steel) and piston designs were varied to eliminate
   Hertzian cracking and to improve performance. Testing was extended from
   a monolayer ceramic (leucite-filled glass) to a bilayer ceramic system
   (glass-infiltrated alumina). The influence of cyclic rate on mean
   failure loads was examined (2 Hz, 10 Hz, 20 Hz) with the extremes
   compared statistically (t test; alpha=.05).
   Results. Failure loads were highly influenced by base elastic modulus (t
   test; P<.001). Cyclic loading while in water significantly decreased
   mean failure loads (1-way ANOVA; P=.003) versus wet storage/dry cycling
   (350 N vs. 1270 N). G10 was not significantly different from hydrated
   dentin in terms of blunt contact elastic behavior or resin cement bond
   strength. Testing was successful with the bilayered ceramic, and the
   cycling rate altered mean failure loads only slightly (approximately
   5\%).
   Conclusions. Test methods and materials were developed to validly
   simulate many aspects of clinical failure. (J Prosthet Dent

Abstract = {{Service life and durability of reinforced concrete structures have
   become a crucial issue because of the economical and ecological
   implications. Service life of reinforced concrete structures is often
   limited by penetration of water and chemical compounds dissolved in
   water into the porous cement-based material. By now it is well-known
   that cracks in reinforced concrete are preferential paths for ingress of
   aggressive substances. Neutron radiography was successfully applied to
   study the process of water penetration into cracked steel reinforced
   concrete. In addition, the effectiveness of integral water repellent
   concrete to prevent ingress of water and salt solutions was
   investigated. Results are described in detail in this contribution. It
   will be shown that neutron radiography is a powerful method to visualize
   the process of water penetration into cracked and uncracked cement-based
   materials. On the basis of the obtained experimental data, it is
   possible to quantify the time-dependent water distributions in concrete
   with high accuracy and spatial resolution. It is of particular interest
   that penetration of water and salt solutions into damaged interfaces
   between concrete and steel can be visualized by means of neutron
   radiography. Deteriorating processes in cracked reinforced concrete
   structures can be studied in a completely new way. This advanced
   technology will help and find adequate ways to improve durability and
   service life of reinforced concrete structures. This will mean at the
   same time an essential contribution to improved sustainabihty. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The paper demonstrates the application of cross-modulation
   vibro-acoustic technique for impact-damage detection in composite
   laminates. A composite plate is monitored for damage resulting from a
   low-velocity impact. The plate is excited simultaneously with two
   harmonic signals: a slow amplitude-modulated vibration pumping wave and
   a constant amplitude-probing wave. The frequency of both the excitation
   signals coincides with the resonances of the plate. An electromagnetic
   shaker is used to introduce the pumping wave to the plate. Two
   surface-bonded, low-profile piezoceramic transducers are used for
   probing-wave excitation and measurement. The wave modulation is
   transferred from the pumping wave to the probing wave in the presence of
   impact damage. This effect is exhibited in a power spectrum of the
   probing wave by a pattern of sidebands around the carrier harmonic. The
   results show that the amplitude of the sidebands is related to the
   severity of damage. The study also investigates also the effect of
   boundary conditions on the results.}},

Abstract = {{This manuscript investigates compression-after-impact failure in woven
   fiber-reinforced composites. Compression failure of composite structures
   previously damaged by an impact event is due to the propagation of
   impact-induced damage mechanisms such as interlaminar debonding,
   constituent (i.e., matrix and fiber) microcracking, sublaminate
   buckling, as well as the interactions between these mechanisms. The
   failure mechanisms within each ply are idealized based on a reduced
   order multiscale computational model, in which, the damage propagation
   in the matrix and fibers upon compression is explicitly modeled.
   Delamination along the ply interfaces is idealized using a cohesive
   surface model. The initial impact-induced damage within the
   microconstituents and interfaces are inferred from experimental
   observations. A suite of numerical simulations is conducted to
   understand the sublaminate buckling, propagation of delamination and

Title = {{Elastic moduli evolution and accompanying stress changes with increasing
   crack damage: implications for stress changes around fault zones and

Abstract = {{P>The elastic moduli of rock in areas susceptible to crack damage, such
   as within fault zones or volcanic edifices, can be subject to large
   modifications. Knowledge of how elastic moduli may vary in such
   situations is important for both the reliable modelling of volcano
   deformation and stability and for linear and non-linear elastic crack
   models for earthquake rupture. Furthermore, it has previously been shown
   that changes in elastic moduli can induce changes in the stress field
   surrounding faults. Here we report both uniaxial experimental
   measurements of changes in elastic moduli during increasing-amplitude
   cyclic stressing experiments on a range of different rock types
   (basalts, sandstones and granite) and the results of modelled stress
   modifications. The trend in elastic moduli evolution with increasing
   damage was remarkably similar for each rock type, with the exception of
   essentially crack-free intrusive basalt that exhibited very minor
   changes. In general, Young's modulus decreased by between 11 and 32 per
   cent and Poisson's ratio increased by between 72 and 600 per cent over
   the total sequence of loading cycles. These changes are attributed to an
   increasing level of anisotropic crack damage within the samples. Our
   results also show that acoustic emission (AE) output during any loading
   cycle only commenced when new crack damage was generated. This
   corresponded to the level of stress where AE ceased during the unloading
   portion of the previous cycle. Using the multilayer elastic model of
   Faulkner et al. we demonstrate that the damage-induced changes in
   elastic moduli also result in significant decreases in differential
   stress, increases in mean stress and rotation of the applied greatest
   principal stress relative to the orientation of the mechanical layering.
   The similar trend in the evolution of the elastic moduli of all the
   rocks tested suggests that stress modification in the damage zone of
   faults might take the same form, regardless of the lithology through
   which the fault runs. These observations are discussed in terms of their
   applicability to both fault zones and deformation at volcanoes.}},

Abstract = {{A constitutive model to predict stiffness reduction due to transverse
   matrix cracking is derived for laminae with arbitrary orientation,
   subject to in-plane stress, embedded in laminates with symmetric but
   otherwise arbitrary laminate stacking sequence. The moduli of the
   damaged laminate are a function of the crack densities in the damaging
   laminae, which are analyzed one by one. The evolution of crack density
   in each lamina is derived in terms of the calculated strain energy
   release rate and predicted as function of the applied load using a
   fracture mechanics approach. Unlike plasticity-inspired formulations.
   the proposed model does not postulate damage evolution functions and
   thus there is no need for additional experimental data to adjust
   material parameters. All that it is needed are the elastic moduli and
   critical energy release rates for the laminae. The reduction of lamina
   stiffness is an integral part of the model, allowing for stress
   redistribution among laminae. Comparisons with experimental data and
   some results from the literature are presented. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Failure patterns and mechanical behaviour of high-performance fibre
   reinforced cementitious composites depend on the distribution of fibres
   within a specimen. In this contribution, we propose a novel
   computational approach to describe failure processes in fibre reinforced
   concrete. A discrete treatment of fibres enables us to study the
   influence of various fibre distributions on the mechanical properties of
   the material. To ensure numerical efficiency, fibres are not explicitly
   discretized but they are modelled by applying discrete forces to a
   background mesh. The background mesh represents the matrix while the
   discrete forces represent the interaction between fibres and matrix.
   These forces are assumed to be equal to fibre pull-out forces. With this
   approach experimental data or micro mechanical models, including
   detailed information about the fibre-matrix interface, can be directly
   incorporated into the model. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper deals with hydrogen embrittlement (HE) susceptibility
   of a high strength steel grade (X80). The respective implication of
   different hydrogen populations, i.e. adsorbed, dissolved in interstitial
   sites, trapped on dislocations and/or microstructural elements on the
   associated embrittlement mechanisms has been addressed through
   mechanical testing in high pressure of hydrogen gas at room temperature.
   Tensile tests at various strain rates and hydrogen pressures have been
   carried out. Moreover, changes of gas (hydrogen or nitrogen) during
   loading have been imposed in order to get critical experiments able to
   discriminate among the potential hydrogen embrittlement mechanisms
   already proposed in the literature. The results of these tests have
   shown that hydrogen induces several kind of damages including decohesion
   along ferrite/pearlite interfaces and microcracks initiations on the
   specimens external surface. It is shown that decohesion is not critical
   under the loading paths used in the present study. On the contrary, it
   appears that the external microcracks initiation, followed by a
   quasi-cleavage fracture, is responsible for the premature failure of the
   material in high pressure of hydrogen gas. These experimental results
   have been further discussed by modeling hydrogen diffusion in order to
   identify hydrogen populations (adsorbed, diffusible or trapped) involved
   in HE. It was then demonstrated that adsorbed and near surface
   diffusible hydrogen are mainly responsible for embrittlement. (C) 2010
