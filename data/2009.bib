Abstract = {{Self-healing of Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECC) subjected to
   two different cyclic wetting and drying regimes was investigated in this
   paper. To quantify self-healing, resonant frequency measurements were
   conducted throughout wetting-drying cycles followed by uniaxial tensile
   testing of self-healing ECC specimens. Through self-healing,
   crack-damaged ECC recovered 76\% to 100\% of its initial resonant
   frequency value and attained a distinct rebound in stiffness. Even for
   specimens deliberately pre-damaged with microcracks by loading up to 3\%
   tensile strain, the tensile strain capacity after self-healing recovered
   close to 100\% that of virgin specimens without any preloading. Also,
   the effects of temperature during wetting-drying cycles led to an
   increase in the ultimate strength but a slight decrease in the tensile
   strain capacity of rehealed pre-damaged specimens. This paper describes
   the experimental investigations and presents the data that confirm
   reasonably robust autogenous healing of ECC in commonly encountered
   environments for many types of infrastructure. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this study, the impact response of unidirectional glass/epoxy
   laminates has been investigated by considering energy profile diagrams
   and associated load-deflection curves. Damage modes and the damage

   different stacking sequences, {[}0/90/0/90](s) and {[}0/90/+45/-45](s),
   were chosen in tests for comparison. All alternative method, based on
   variation of the excessive energy (E(e)) versus impact energy (E(i)), is
   presented to determine penetration threshold (Pn). The penetration
   threshold for stacking sequence {[}0/90/+45/-45](s) is found to be
   smaller than that of {[}0/90/0/90](s). The primary damage mode was found
   to be fiber fracture for higher impact energies; whereas, it was
   indentation resulting in delamination and matrix cracks for smaller
   impact energies. Contour plots of the overall damage areas are also
   depicted for several impact energies. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper is the follow-up on the previous work by the authors on the
   experimental evaluation of the impact damage resistance of laminates
   with dispersed stacking sequences. The current work focuses on the

   Constitutive models which take into account the physical progressive
   failure behaviour of fibres, matrix, and interfaces between plies were
   implemented in an explicit finite element method and used in the
   simulation of low-velocity impact events on composite laminates. The
   computational effort resulted in reliable predictions of the impact
   dynamics, impact footprint, locus and size of delaminations, matrix
   cracks and fibre damage, as well as the amount of energy dissipated
   through delaminations, intraply damage and friction. The accuracy
   achieved with this method increases the reliability of numerical methods
   in the simulation of impact loads enabling the reduction of the time and
   costs associated with mechanical testing. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this article, the physical origin of fatigue crack initiation in
   ductile metals is discussed from a historical perspective. The main
   focus is to assess those cyclic slip irreversibilities in a
   microstructural sense that occur not only at the surface but also in the
   bulk at the dislocation scale and to show how they contribute to surface
   fatigue damage. The evolution of early fatigue damage, as evidenced
   experimentally in the last decades, is reviewed. The phenomenon of
   cyclic strain localization in persistent slip bands (PSBs) and models of
   the formation of extrusions, intrusions, and microcracks are discussed
   in detail. The predictions of these models are compared with
   experimental evidence obtained on mono- and polycrystalline
   face-centered-cubic (fcc) metals. In addition, examples of the evolution
   of fatigue damage in selected fcc solid solution alloys and
   precipitation-hardened alloys and in body-centered-cubic (bcc) metals
   are analyzed. Where possible, the cyclic slip irreversibilities p,
   defined as the fraction of plastic shear strain that is
   microstructurally irreversible, have been estimated quantitatively.
   Broadly speaking, p has been found to vary over orders of magnitude (0 <
   p < 1), being almost negligible at low loading amplitudes (high fatigue
   lives) and substantial at larger loading amplitudes (low fatigue lives).}},

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional (2-D) continuous wavelet transform (CWT)-based damage
   detection algorithm using ``Dergauss2d{''} wavelet for plate-type
   structures is presented. The 2-D CWT considered in this study is based
   on the formulation by Antoine et al. (2004). A concept of isosurface of
   2-D wavelet coefficients is proposed, and it is generated to indicate
   the location and approximate shape or area of the damage. The proposed
   algorithm is a response-based damage detection technique which only
   requires the mode shapes of the damaged plates. This algorithm is
   applied to the numerical vibration mode shapes of a cantilever plate
   with different types of damage to illustrate its effectiveness and
   viability. A comparative study with other two 2-D damage detection
   algorithms, i.e., 2-D gapped smoothing method (GSM) and 2-D strain
   energy method (SEM), is performed, and it demonstrates that the proposed
   2-D CWT-based algorithm is superior in noise immunity and robust with
   limited sensor data. The algorithm is further implemented in an
   experimental modal test to detect impact damage in an FRP composite
   plate using smart piezoelectric actuators and sensors, demonstrating its
   applicability to the experimental mode shapes. The present 2-D CWT-based
   algorithm is among a few limited studies in the literature to explore
   the application of 2-D wavelets in damage detection. and as demonstrated
   in this study, it can be used as a viable and effective technique for
   damage identification of plate- or shell-type structures. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{The presence of aggressive fluids and their transport is by far the most
   important factor controlling the durability of cement based composites.
   In structural concrete, the application of mechanical stress leads to
   cracking, which in turn affects the transport properties adversely, but
   very little is known of this influence. The paper highlights the vast
   discrepancy between experimentally determined permeability data, which
   appear to be largely artifacts of disparate test procedures. In
   particular, it is not clear if an equilibrium was attained in the fluid
   flow and further, whether the flow measurements were made in the
   presence of the applied stress, which together make it very difficult to
   compare experimental data. Nevertheless it is clear that stress induced
   cracking leads to a surge in fluid flow and there exists a threshold
   value for both the applied stress and the resultant crack width
   associated with fluid permeability in concrete. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A new data reduction scheme is proposed for measuring the critical
   fracture energy of adhesive joints under pure mode II loading using the

   proposed methodology also accounts for the energy dissipated at the
   Fracture Process Zone which is not negligible when ductile adhesives are
   used. Experimental tests and numerical analyses using a trapezoidal
   cohesive mixed-mode damage model demonstrated the good performance of
   the new method. namely when compared to classical data reduction
   schemes. An inverse method was used to determine the cohesive
   properties, fitting the numerical and experimental load-displacement
   curves. Excellent agreement between the numerical and experimental
   R-curves was achieved demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed

Abstract = {{This study focuses on the description of damage and failure behaviour of
   triaxial braided carbon/epoxy composites under tension. The tensile
   tests were instrumented with optical surface strain and acoustic
   emission measurements. Damage was observed using X-ray and microscopy.
   The damage develops in two stages: (I) intra-yarn cracking: increase of
   the crack density and crack length, (2) local inter-yarn delamination
   and conjunction of the intra-yarn cracks. Statistics of crack sizes at
   both stages were collected and the 3D geometry of cracks was
   reconstructed. A finite element model of the unit cell of the textile
   reinforcement is used to predict damage initiation and crack orientation
   using Puck's criterion. Progressive damage and stiffness deterioration
   is modelled using the degradation scheme of Murakami-Ohno and the damage
   evolution law of Ladeveze, applied to the average stress state of the
   yarns. Good agreement with experimental damage initiation threshold and
   non-linear tensile diagrams is found both for loading in fibre and
   off-axis directions. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A two-component healing agent consisting of epoxy- and ((C(2)H(5))(2)O
   center dot BF(3))-loaded microcapsules was synthesized and applied to
   fabricate self-healing epoxy composites. Curing of epoxy healing agent
   catalyzed by (C(2)H(5))(2)O.BF(3) belongs to cationic chain
   polymerization, which is characterized by fast reaction at ambient
   temperature and low catalyst concentration. The experimental results
   showed that cracks in the composites containing the above healing system
   can be quickly re-bonded with satisfied healing efficiency. In the case
   of 5 wt\% epoxy- and 1 wt\% (C(2)H(5))(2)O center dot BF(3)-loaded
   capsules, for example, a similar to 80\% recovery of impact strength was
   detected within 30 min at 20 degrees C. Because the healing capsules
   took effect at low content, mechanical properties of the matrix were
   largely retained. It is believed that the present healing system
   provides a possible solution to preparation of self-healing polymeric
   materials with practical applicability. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Composites fabricated by VARTM technology with the use of single-ply
   non-crimp 3D orthogonal woven preforms 3WEAVE (R) find fast growing
   research interest and industrial applications. It is now well understood
   and appreciated that this type of advanced composites provides efficient
   delamination suppression, enhanced damage tolerance, and superior
   impact, ballistic and blast performance characteristics over 2D fabric
   laminates. At the same time, this type of composites, having practically
   straight in-plane fibers, show significantly better in-plane stiffness
   and strength properties than respective properties of a
   ``conventional{''} type 3D interlock weave composites. One primarily
   important question, which has not been addressed yet, is how the
   in-plane elastic and strength characteristics of this type of composites
   compare with respective in-plane properties of ``equivalent{''}
   laminates made of 2D woven fabrics. This 2-part paper presents a
   comprehensive experimental study of the comparison of in-plane tensile
   properties of two single-ply non-crimp 3D orthogonal weave E-glass fiber
   composites on one side and a laminate reinforced with four plies of
   plain weave E-glass fabric on the other. Results obtained from
   mechanical testing are supplemented by acoustic emission data providing
   damage initiation thresholds, progressive cracks observation, full-field
   surface strain mapping and cracks observation on micrographs. The
   obtained results demonstrate that the studied 3D non-crimp orthogonal
   woven composites have considerably higher in-plane ultimate failure
   stresses and strains, as well as damage initiation strain thresholds
   than their 2D woven laminated composite counterpart. Part I presents the
   description of materials used, experimental techniques applied,
   principal results and their mutual comparisons for the three tested
   composites. Part 2 describes in detail the experimentally observed
   effects and trends with the main focus on the progressive damage:
   detailed results of AE registration, full-field strain measurements and
   progressive damage observations, highlighting peculiarities of local
   damage patterns and explaining the succession of local damage events,
   which leads to the differences in strength values between 2D and 3D
   composites. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper was to address the effects of laser shock
   processing (LSP) on the residual stresses and micro-hardness of the
   turbojet engine blades manufactured by LY2 aluminum alloy, and fatigue
   performance of the notched specimens cut from LY2 blade plate. First,
   the effects of the number of shocks used in LSP on the residual stresses
   and micro-hardness at the edge of the turbojet engine blade were
   investigated. Second, the low cyclic fatigue performance on the
   specimens cut from the blade was evaluated. Experimental results showed
   that the compressive residual stresses and the high micro-hardness would
   be generated near the surface due to LSP. The thickness of the plastic
   deformation layer generated due to the shock wave in LSP was higher than
   2.0 mm. By comparing with the untreated specimens, the fatigue lives of
   the specimens after LSP were obviously increased due to the compressive
   residual stresses near the surface. Crown Copyright (c) 2008 Published
