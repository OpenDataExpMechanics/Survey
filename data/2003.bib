Abstract = {{A new decohesion element with the capability of dealing with crack
   propagation under mixed-mode loading is proposed and demonstrated. The
   element is used at the interface between solid finite elements to model
   the initiation and non-self-similar growth of delaminations in composite
   materials. A single relative displacement-based damage parameter is
   applied in a softening law to track the damage state of the interface
   and to prevent the restoration of the cohesive state during unloading.
   The softening law is applied in the three-parameter Benzeggagh-Kenane
   mode interaction criterion to predict mixed-mode delamination
   propagation. To demonstrate the accuracy of the predictions,
   steady-state delamination growth is simulated for quasi-static loading
   of various single mode and mixed-mode delamination test specimens and

Abstract = {{In recent years, significant efforts have been devoted to developing
   non-destructive techniques for damage identification in structures. The
   work reported in this paper is part of an ongoing research on the
   experimental investigations of the effects of cracks and damages on the
   integrity of structures, with a view to detect, quantify, and determine
   their extents and locations. Two sets of aluminum beams were used for
   this experimental study. Each set consisted of seven beams, the first
   set had fixed ends, and the second set was simply supported. Cracks were
   initiated at seven different locations from one end to the other end
   (along the length of the beam) for each set, with crack depth ratios
   ranging from 0.1d to 0.7d (d is the beam depth) in steps of 0.1, at each
   crack location. Measurements of the acceleration frequency responses at
   seven different points on each beam model were taken using a dual
   channel frequency analyzer.
   The damage detection schemes used in this study depended on the measured
   changes in the first three natural frequencies and the corresponding
   amplitudes of the measured acceleration frequency response functions.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study of the relationship between EDM parameters
   and surface cracks by using a full factorial design, based upon
   discharge current and pulse-on time parameters. The study analyzes the
   EDM machining of D2 and H13 tool steels as materials. The formation of
   surface cracks is explored by considering surface roughness, white layer
   thickness, and the stress induced by the EDM process. When the pulse
   voltage is maintained at a constant value of 120 V, it is possible to
   avoid the formation of cracks if machining is carried out with a pulse
   current in the range of 12-16 A together with a pulse-on duration of 6-9
   mus. Based upon the experimental results, this study establishes a crack
   prediction map, and indicates whether or not cracks are likely to form
   for a given pulse-on and pulse current combination. Its use will provide
   a valuable aid in improving the quality of the EDM process. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{In this contribution various aspects of an anisotropic damage model
   coupled to plasticity are considered. The model is formulated within the
   thermodynamic framework and implements a strong coupling between
   plasticity and damage. The constitutive equations for the damaged
   material are written according to the principle of strain energy
   equivalence between the virgin material and the damaged material. The
   damaged material is modeled using the constitutive laws of the effective
   undamaged material in which the nominal stresses are replaced by the
   effective stresses. The model considers different interaction mechanisms
   between damage and plasticity defects in such a way that two-isotropic
   and two-kinematic hardening evolution equations are derived, one of each
   for the plasticity and the other for the damage. An additive
   decomposition of the total strain into elastic and inelastic parts is
   adopted in this work. The elastic part is further decomposed into two
   portions, one is due to the elastic distortion of the material grains
   and the other is due to the crack closure and void contraction. The
   inelastic part is also decomposed into two portions, one is due to
   nucleation and propagation of dislocations and the other is due to the
   lack of crack closure and void contraction. Uniaxial tension tests with
   unloadings have been used to investigate the damage growth in high
   strength steel. A good agreement between the experimental results and
   the model is obtained. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

   solution convergence in the context of cohesive elements used as an
   approach to model crack initiation and propagation; performance of
   parametric studies to assess the role of grain boundary strength and
   toughness, and their stochasticity, on damage initiation and evolution.
   Simulations of wave propagation experiments, performed on alumina, are
   used to illustrate the capabilities of the model in the framework of
   experimental measurements. The solution convergence studies show that
   when the length of the cohesive elements is smaller than the cohesive
   zone size and when the initial slope of the traction-separation cohesive
   law is properly chosen, the predictions concerning microcrack initiation
   and evolution are mesh independent. Other features examined in the
   simulations were the effect of initial stresses and defects resulting
   from the material manufacturing process, Also described are conditions
   on the selection of the representative volume element size, as a
   function of ceramic properties. to capture the proper distance between
   crack initiation sites. Crack branching is predicted in the case of
   strong ceramics and sufficient distance between nucleation sites. Rate
   effects in the extension of microcracks were studied in the context of
   damage kinetics and fragmentation patterns. The simulations show that

Abstract = {{Synchrotron X-ray microtomography has been utilized for the in-situ
   observation of steady-state plane-strain fatigue crack growth. A
   high-resolution experimental configuration and phase contrast imaging
   technique have enabled the reconstruction of crack images with an
   isotropic voxel with a 0.7 mum edge. The details of a crack are readily
   observed, together with evidence of the incidence and mechanical
   influence of closure. After preliminary investigations of the achievable
   accuracy and reproducibility, a variety of measurement methods are used
   to quantify crack-opening displacement (COD) and closure from the
   tomography data. Utilization of the physical displacements of
   microstructural features is proposed to obtain detailed COD data, and
   its feasibility is confirmed. Loss of fracture surface contact occurs
   gradually up to the maximum load. This is significantly different from
   tendencies reported where a single definable opening level is
   essentially assumed to exist. The closure behaviour is found to be
   attributable mainly to pronounced generation of mode III displacement
   which may be caused by local crack topology. Many small points of
   closure still remain near the crack tip, suggesting that the near-tip
   contact induces crack growth resistance. The effects of overloading are
   also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a numerical study of creep crack growth (CCG) in a
   fracture mechanics specimen. The material properties used are
   representative of a carbon-manganese steel at 360 degreesC and the
   constitutive behaviour of the steel is described by a power law creep
   model. A damage-based approach is used to predict the crack propagation
   rate in a compact tension specimen and the data are correlated against
   an independently determined C{*} parameter. Elastic-creep and
   elastic-plastic-creep analyses are performed using two different crack
   growth criteria to predict crack extension under plane stress and plane
   strain conditions. The plane strain crack growth rate predicted from the
   numerical analysis is found to be less conservative than the plane
   strain upper bound of an existing ductility exhaustion model, for values
   of C{*} within the limits of the present CCG testing standards. At low
   values of C{*} the predicted plane stress and plane strain crack growth
   rates differ by a factor between 5 and 30 depending on the creep
   ductility of the material. However, at higher loads and C{*} values, the
   plane strain crack growth rates, predicted using an
   elastic-plastic-creep material response, approach those for plane
   stress. These results are consistent with experimental data for the
   material and suggest that purely elastic-creep modelling is unrealistic
   for the carbon-manganese steel as plastic strains are significant at
   relevant loading levels. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},
