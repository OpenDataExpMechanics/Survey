  Abstract                 = {{Recently, significant attention has been devoted to the utilization of
 new sensing technologies for pavement maintenance and preservation
 systems. This study presents a new approach for the continuous health
 monitoring of asphalt concrete pavements based on piezoelectric
 self-powered sensing technology. The beauty of this technology is that
 the signal sensed by the piezoelectric transducers from traffic loading
 can be used both for empowering the self-powered sensors and damage
 diagnosis. Numerical and experimental studies were carried out to
 evaluate the damage detection performance of the proposed self-sustained
 sensing system. A three-dimensional finite element analysis was
 performed to obtain the pavement responses under moving tire loading.
 Damage was introduced as bottom-up fatigue cracks at the bottom of the
 asphalt layer. Thereafter, features extracted from the dynamic strain
 data for a number of sensing nodes were used to detect the damage
 progression. The laboratory tests were carried out on an asphalt
 concrete specimen in three point bending mode. For the protection of the
 embedded sensors, a new miniaturized spherical packaging system was
 designed and tested. Based on the results of the numerical study, the
 sensing nodes located along the loading path are capable of detecting
 the damage progression. Besides, the experimental study indicates that
 the proposed method is efficient in detecting different damage states
 including crack propagation. Finally, the possibility of localizing the
 damage and quantifying its severity was investigated and discussed. (C)

  Abstract                 = {{The study of near-threshold fatigue crack growth has long remained an
 empirical field due principally to the highly microstructure-sensitive
 nature thereof. The primary challenges have been to forward physical
 model(s) informed by the governing micromechanism(s), which would be
 able to predict the experimental behaviors devoid of empiricism. Today,
 we have sophisticated experimental techniques (e.g. digital image
 correlation, electron microscopy) as well as atomistic simulation tools
 (e.g. molecular dynamics) at our disposal to finally revisit the century
 old fatigue problem in the light of physical phenomena therein. This
 paper is geared towards achieving such a feat with a very special type
 of materials, nano-twinned alloys, as the candidate materials, which are
 of great recent interest due to their reportedly superior damage
 properties. Specifically, we investigate how the microstructural
 features (e.g. slip transfer mechanism at coherent twin boundaries, twin
 thickness/spacing, frictional stress, pre-existent near-tip slip
 density) can be modulated to improve the damage resistance. The results
 suggest that these parameters considerably affect the crack propagation
 impedance (as quantified in terms of Delta K-eff(th)). A thorough
 discussion of the current findings and the most recent literature
 developments in this regard are provided. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

  Abstract                 = {{Landslides often cause economic losses, property damage, and loss of
 lives. Monitoring landslides using high spatial and temporal resolution
 imagery and the ability to quickly identify landslide regions are the
 basis for emergency disaster management. This study presents a
 comprehensive system that uses unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and
 Semi-Global dense Matching (SGM) techniques to identify and extract
 landslide scarp data. The selected study area is located along a major
 highway in a mountainous region in Jordan, and contains creeping
 landslides induced by heavy rainfall. Field observations across the
 slope body and a deformation analysis along the highway and existing
 gabions indicate that the slope is active and that scarp features across
 the slope will continue to open and develop new tension crack features,
 leading to the downward movement of rocks. The identification of
 landslide scarps in this study was performed via a dense 3D point cloud
 of topographic information generated from high-resolution images
 captured using a low-cost UAV and a target-based camera calibration
 procedure for a low-cost large-field-of-view camera. An automated
 approach was used to accurately detect and extract the landslide head
 scarps based on geomorphological factors: the ratio of normalized
 Eigenvalues (i.e., 1/2 3) derived using principal component analysis,
 topographic surface roughness index values, and local-neighborhood slope
 measurements from the 3D image-based point cloud. Validation of the
 results was performed using root mean square error analysis and a
 confusion (error) matrix between manually digitized landslide scarps and
 the automated approaches. The experimental results using the fully
 automated 3D point-based analysis algorithms show that these approaches
 can effectively distinguish landslide scarps. The proposed algorithms
 can accurately identify and extract landslide scarps with
 centimeter-scale accuracy. In addition, the combination of UAV-based
 imagery, 3D scene reconstruction, and landslide scarp
 recognition/extraction algorithms can provide flexible and effective
 tool for monitoring landslide scarps and is acceptable for landslide
 mapping purposes.}},

 proposed in the kinematically linear regime is extended to the
 three-dimensional finite strain setting, and its predictions are
 qualitatively and quantitatively compared with several experimental
 results, both from ad-hoc tests carried out by the authors and from the
 available literature. The proposed model is based on the physical
 assumption that fracture occurs when a scalar measure of the accumulated
 plastic strain reaches a critical value, and such assumption is
 introduced through the dependency of the phase-field degradation
 function on this scalar measure. The proposed model is able to capture
 the experimentally observed sequence of elasto-plastic deformation,
 necking and fracture phenomena in flat specimens; the occurrence of
 cup-and-cone fracture patterns in axisymmetric specimens; the role
 played by notches and by their size on the measured displacement at
 fracture; and the sequence of distinct cracking events observed in more
 complex specimens.}},

 subjected to tests. The low-velocity impact test was performed at room
 temperature using a drop-weight impact tester with impact energy 10 J

 tests and numerical analyses have been found compatible in the scope of
 specific relationships i.e. force vs. time, internal damage areas and
 laminates damage mechanism prevailing in their structure. The principal
 laminates damage forms encompassed delaminations occurring in composite
 interlayers and on metal-composite interface, cracks in composite layers
 and in lower layers of metal. Presented modelling of impact in fibre
 metal laminates using VUMAT code enables the evaluation of their
 structure damage and the selection of proper laminate configuration in

  Abstract                 = {{Ductile failure of structural metals is relevant to a wide range of
 engineering scenarios. Computational methods are employed to anticipate
 the critical conditions of failure, yet they sometimes provide
 inaccurate and misleading predictions. Challenge scenarios, such as the
 one presented in the current work, provide an opportunity to assess the
 blind, quantitative predictive ability of simulation methods against a
 previously unseen failure problem. Rather than evaluate the predictions
 of a single simulation approach, the Sandia Fracture Challenge relies on
 numerous volunteer teams with expertise in computational mechanics to
 apply a broad range of computational methods, numerical algorithms, and
 constitutive models to the challenge. This exercise is intended to
 evaluate the state of health of technologies available for failure
 prediction. In the first Sandia Fracture Challenge, a wide range of
 issues were raised in ductile failure modeling, including a lack of
 consistency in failure models, the importance of shear calibration data,
 and difficulties in quantifying the uncertainty of prediction {[}see
 Boyce et al. (Int J Fract 186:5-68, 2014) for details of these
 observations]. This second Sandia Fracture Challenge investigated the
 ductile rupture of a Ti-6Al-4V sheet under both quasi-static and
 modest-rate dynamic loading (failure in 0.1 s). Like the previous
 challenge, the sheet had an unusual arrangement of notches and holes
 that added geometric complexity and fostered a competition between
 tensile- and shear-dominated failure modes. The teams were asked to
 predict the fracture path and quantitative far-field failure metrics
 such as the peak force and displacement to cause crack initiation.
 Fourteen teams contributed blind predictions, and the experimental
 outcomes were quantified in three independent test labs. Additional
 shortcomings were revealed in this second challenge such as
 inconsistency in the application of appropriate boundary conditions,
 need for a thermomechanical treatment of the heat generation in the
 dynamic loading condition, and further difficulties in model calibration
 based on limited real-world engineering data. As with the prior
 challenge, this work not only documents the `state-of-the-art' in
 computational failure prediction of ductile tearing scenarios, but also
 provides a detailed dataset for non-blind assessment of alternative
 methods.}},

 immediate vicinity of the notch root of a flat CT-like specimen made of
 aluminum alloy. Experimental data, partially exploited by Morgeneyer et
 al. (Acta Mat 69:78-91, 2014b), were obtained by using synchrotron
 laminography and the 3D reconstructed volumes are subsequently analyzed
 via Digital volume correlation. These data enable for in situ
 assessments of strain fields and ductile damage in the zone where the
 stress triaxiality evolves from elevated to lower levels, which is
 accompanied by flat-to-slant crack transition. The measured strain field
 patterns in this area are analyzed herein in a systematic manner by
 studying the incremental strain activity during several loading steps.
 It is shown that from the very beginning of the loading history multiple
 slant strained bands appear in front of the notch root while the
 corresponding damage growth sets in at later loading stages and higher
 strains. The activity of the different strained bands at the notch root
 is alternating between different locations over the loading history.
 However, the band leading to final rupture is always active. The region
 where slant fracture occurs is identified to be in plane strain
 condition with respect to the crack propagation direction.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Detection of multiple damage using modal curvature in noisy environments
 has become a research focus of considerable challenge and great
 significance over the last few years. However, a noticeable deficiency
 of modal curvature is its susceptibility to noise, which usually results
 in a noisy modal curvature with obscured damage signature. To address
 this deficiency, this study formulates a new concept of complex-wavelet
 modal curvature. Complex-wavelet modal curvature features the ability to
 reveal and delineate damage under noisy conditions. The effectiveness of
 the concept is analytically verified using cracked beams with various
 types of boundary conditions. The applicability is further
 experimentally validated by an aluminum beam with a single crack and a
 carbon-fiber reinforced polymer composite beam with three cracks in the
 laboratory with mode shapes measured by a scanning laser vibrometer.
 Both analytical and experimental results have demonstrated that the
 complex-wavelet modal curvature is capable of revealing slight damage by
 eliminating noise interference, with no need for prior knowledge of
 either material properties or boundary conditions of the beam under
 inspection. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

  Abstract                 = {{A prior study conducted by the authors had investigated the behaviour of
 thin composite double lap joint repairs. This investigation was an
 extension to the previous study and focused on analysing the behaviour
 of thick step lap joint repairs which are more complicated in nature.
 Finite element analysis (FEA) was performed to verify the static and
 fatigue strength of bolted, bonded and hybrid joint configurations.
 Thick carbon fibre/epoxy laminates and aerospace grade film adhesive and
 fasteners were selected. Several configurations were considered in this
 case. These include varying the number of fasteners in the joint region
 as well as inclusion of bondline defects. Adhesive non-linear material
 properties, fastener contacts and frictional forces were all included in
 the three dimensional (3D) finite element (FE) models. The progressive
 failure process was simulated and the Multicontinuum Theory (MCT) was
 used to determine the stress states in all specimens considered. The
 strain energy release rate (SERR) as a function of crack length was also
 utilised to gain further understanding into the fatigue behaviour.
 Overall the FE models are able to accurately predict the bonded, bolted
 and hybrid joint strengths. SERR results suggest it is vital to place
 fasteners closer to the ends of the overlap to suppress the peak peeling
 stresses and to delay the effects of early crack initiation. This
 overall improves the longevity of a conventional bonded joint design.

  Abstract                 = {{A detailed understanding of damage evolution in rock after
 high-temperature treatment in unloading conditions is extremely
 important in underground engineering applications, such as the disposal
 of highly radioactive nuclear waste, underground coal gasification, and
 post-disaster reconstruction. We have studied the effects of temperature
 (200, 400, 600 and 800 A degrees C) and confining pressure (20, 30 and
 40 MPa) on the mechanical properties of sandstone. Scanning electron
 microscopy studies revealed that at temperatures exceeding 400 A degrees
 C, new cracks formed, and original cracks extended substantially. When
 the confining pressure was 20 MPa, a temperature increase from 400 to
 800 A degrees C resulted in a 75.2\% increase in peak strain, a decrease
 in Young's modulus and peak strength of 62.5 and 35.8 \%, respectively,
 and transition of the failure mechanism from brittleness to ductility.
 In the triaxial compression tests, the specimen deformed in a more
 obvious ductile failure manner at higher confining pressure, whereas in
 the unloading confining pressure experiments, brittle failure was more
 obvious when the initial confining pressure was higher. We focused on
 the effects of temperature and initial confining pressure on peak
 effective loading stress and peak ductile deformation during unloading.
 At temperatures of > 400 A degrees C, the peak ductile deformation
 increased rapidly with increases in the high temperature treatment or
 initial confining pressure. The peak effective loading stress decreased
 sharply with increased temperature but barely changed when the initial
 confining pressure was varied.}},

  Abstract                 = {{This work aims to investigate compressive strength changes,
 Vickers-hardness of exposed surface, microstructure evolution and pore
 structure of geopolymer prepared using fly ash as resource material and
 activated by sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide solutions after
 exposed to sulfate attack for 28, 90 and 180 days when fly ash was
 partially replaced by metakaolin at levels ranging from 0\% to 20\% with
 an interval of 5\%, by weight.
 The experimental results uncover that geopolymer suffers strength loss
 after sulfate attack exposure but gains strength with increasing
 replacement level of fly ash by metakaolin from 5\% to 20\% and obvious
 increasing in compressive strength could be observed when the
 replacement percentage exceeds 15\%. The sulfate attack exposure shifts
 the peak value of pore size to a higher value and leads to the
 development of a macropore system with high porosity and deduction of
 surface Vickers-hardness. A denser microstructure with higher surface
 Vickers-hardness of metakaolin containing geopolymer can be obtained
 compared to geopolymer without metakaolin. A good linear relationship
 has been found between compressive strength loss and Vickers-hardness
 values of exposed surface. Compressive strength loss in geopolymer after
 sulfate attack exposure relates to the microcrack development and high
 porosity. Longer exposure leads to higher deduction in compressive
 strength and acceleration in deterioration degree which lead to
 expansion stress and cracks. Partial replacement of fly ash by
 metakaolin improves the mechanical properties, optimizes the
 microstructure and reduces the level of damage from sulfate attack. (C)
