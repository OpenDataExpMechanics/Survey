Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{44}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Many of the earliest laboratory studies of the brittle-ductile
   transition were on porous rocks, with a focus on the evolution of
   failure mode from brittle faulting to cataclastic flow with increasing
   pressure. Recent advances in this area are reviewed. Porosity has been
   demonstrated to exert critical control on the brittle-ductile
   transition, and its phenomenology has two common attributes. Under low
   confinement, brittle faulting develops as a dilatant failure mode. Under
   high confinement, delocalized cataclasis is accompanied by
   shear-enhanced compaction and strain hardening. Plasticity models such
   as the cap and critical state models have been developed to describe
   such constitutive behaviors, and many aspects of the laboratory data on
   porous rock have been shown to be in basic agreement. Bifurcation
   analysis can be used in conjunction with a constitutive model to predict
   the onset of strain localization, which is in qualitative agreement with
   the laboratory data. However, recent studies have also underscored
   certain complexities in the inelastic behavior and failure mode. In some
   porous sandstones, compaction bands would develop as a localized failure
   mode intermediate between the end members of brittle faulting and
   cataclastic flow. In limestones (and selected sandstones) under
   relatively high confinement, cataclastic flow is accompanied first by
   shear-enhanced compaction which then evolves to dilatancy. Various
   techniques have been employed to characterize the microstructure and
   damage, which have elucidated the deformation mechanisms associated with
   the brittle-ductile transition. These observations have revealed a
   diversity of micromechanical processes, and fundamental differences were
   observed especially between sandstone and limestone with regard to
   inelastic compaction. Micromechanical models that have been formulated
   to describe these processes include the pore-emanated and sliding wing
   crack models in the brittle faulting regime, and the Hertzian fracture
   and cataclastic pore collapse models in the cataclastic flow regime.
   Numerical techniques based on the discrete element method have also been
   employed to simulate these processes. Comparison of the model
   predictions with laboratory and microstructural observations has
   provided useful insights into the mechanics of brittle-ductile
   transition in porous rock. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cracking processes have been extensively studied in brittle rock and
   rock-like materials. Due to the experimental limitations and the
   complexity of rock texture, details of the cracking processes could not
   always be observed and assessed comprehensively. To contribute to this
   field of research, a numerical approach based on the particle element
   model was used in present study. It would give us insights into what is
   happening to crack initiation, propagation and coalescence. Parallel
   bond model, a type of bonded-particle model, was used to numerically
   simulate the cracking process in rock-like material containing a single
   flaw under uniaxial vertical compression. The single flaw's inclinations
   varied from 0A degrees to 75A degrees measured from the horizontal. As
   the uniaxial compression load was increased, multiple new microcracks
   initiated in the rock, which later propagated and eventually coalesced
   into longer macrocracks. The inclination of the pre-existing flaw was
   found to have a strong influence on the crack initiation and propagation
   patterns. The simulations replicated most of the phenomena observed in
   the physical experiments, such as the type, the initiation location and
   the initiate angle of the first cracks, as well as the development of
   hair-line cracks, which later evolved to macrocracks. Analyses of the
   parallel bond forces and displacement fields revealed some important
   mechanisms of the cracking processes. The first cracks typically
   initiated from the tensile stress concentration regions, in which the
   tensile stress was partially released after their initiation. The
   tensile stress concentration regions subsequently shifted outwards close
   to the propagating tips of the first cracks. The initiation and
   propagation of the first cracks would not significantly influence the
   compressive stress singularity at the flaw tips, which was the driving
   force of the initiation of secondary cracks. The initiation of
   microcracking zone consisting almost exclusively of micro-tensile
   cracks, and that of microcracking zone consisting of micro-tensile
   cracks and mixed micro-tensile and shear cracks, were found to be
   correlated with two distinct types of displacement fields, namely type I
   (DF\_I) and type II (DF\_II), respectively.}},

Title = {{Integrated modeling of friction stir welding of 6xxx series Al alloys:
   Process, microstructure and properties}},
Journal = {{PROGRESS IN MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Compared to most thermomechanical processing methods, friction stir
   welding (FSW) is a recent technique which has not yet reached full
   maturity. Nevertheless, owing to multiple intrinsic advantages, FSW has
   already replaced conventional welding methods in a variety of industrial
   applications especially for Al alloys. This provides the impetus for
   developing a methodology towards optimization, from process to
   performances, using the most advanced approach available in materials
   science and thermomechanics. The aim is to obtain a guidance both for
   process fine tuning and for alloy design. Integrated modeling
   constitutes a way to accelerate the insertion of the process, especially
   regarding difficult applications where for instance ductility, fracture
   toughness, fatigue and/or stress corrosion cracking are key issues.
   Hence, an integrated modeling framework devoted to the FSW of 6xxx
   series Al alloys has been established and applied to the 6005A and 6056
   alloys. The suite of models involves an in-process temperature evolution
   model, a microstructure evolution model with an extension to
   heterogeneous precipitation, a microstructure based strength and strain
   hardening model, and a micro-mechanics based damage model. The
   presentation of each model is supplemented by the coverage of relevant
   recent literature. The ``model chain{''} is assessed towards a wide
   range of experimental data. The final objective is to present routes for
   the optimization of the FSW process using both experiments and models.
   Now, this strategy goes well beyond the case of FSW, illustrating the
   potential of chain models to support a ``material by design approach{''}
   from process to performances. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The anisotropic ductile fracture of a 6260-T6 anisotropic aluminum alloy
   extrusion is investigated using a hybrid experimental-numerical
   approach. A basic fracture testing program covering a wide range of
   stress states and different material orientations is carried out. It
   comprises experiments on notched tensile specimens, tensile specimens
   with a central hole and butterfly shear specimens. The surface strain
   fields are obtained using two-dimensional Digital Image Correlation
   (DIC), while detailed finite element simulations are performed of all
   experiments to determine the local stress and strain histories inside
   the specimens. The analysis shows that the use of the newly-proposed
   extension of the Yld2000 yield function for three-dimensional stress
   states (see companion paper) together with an isotropic hardening law is
   able to predict the elasto-plastic behaviors of the present anisotropic
   aluminum alloy in all experiments. The experimental results show a
   strong dependency of the strain to fracture on the material orientation
   with respect to the loading direction. An uncoupled non-associated
   anisotropic fracture model is proposed which makes use of a stress state
   dependent weighting function and an anisotropic plastic strain measure.
   The latter is obtained from applying the von Mises equivalent plastic
   strain definition after the linear transformation of the plastic strain
   tensor. It is shown that the use of the isotropic Modified Mohr-Coulomb
   (MMC) stress state weighting function in this anisotropic fracture
   modeling framework provides accurate predictions of the onset of
   fracture for all thirteen fracture experiments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{When a structure is subjected to dynamic or static loads, cracks may

   to construct a new hybrid crack detection method. The method includes
   two steps: crack localization and depth estimation. The locations of the
   cracks are determined by applying the wavelet transform to the modal
   shape. Using the measured natural frequencies as inputs, the depths of
   the cracks are estimated from a database established by wavelet finite
   element method. The effectiveness of the proposed hybrid two-step method
   is demonstrated by numerical simulation and experimental investigation
   of a cantilever beam with two cracks. Our analyses also indicate that

Abstract = {{In this contribution, a numerical assessment of three isotropic
   constitutive models is performed in order to identify their
   applicability and reliability in the prediction of ductile failure under
   a wide range of stress triaxiality. The well established isotropic
   coupled damage models proposed by Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman (GTN),
   which is based on micromechanical grounds and here extended with a shear
   mechanism, and by Lemaitre, which is based on continuum damage
   mechanics, are selected and investigated. Besides these, an uncoupled
   damage elasto-plastic model proposed by Bai and Wierzibicki, which
   includes the effect of three invariants of the stress tensor, is also
   selected and examined. All constitutive formulations are implemented in
   a quasi-static finite element scheme and applied to simulate the
   behavior of the 2024-T351 aluminum alloy, which is strongly dependent on
   both pressure and Lode angle. To assess the predictive ability of the
   constitutive models under different levels of stress triaxiality,
   specimens with different geometries and dimensions are used, such as:
   smooth and notched cylindrical bars, a plate hole specimen and a
   butterfly specimen. The evaluation of the models is initially carried
   out under pure tensile loading conditions and then under shear dominated
   deformation modes. In addition, a combination of both tensile and shear
   loading is also studied. Finally, the results obtained from the
   numerical simulations are analyzed and critically compared with
   experimental results available in the literature. The performance of
   each constitutive approach under each range of stress triaxiality is
   highlighted and the main observations are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Knowing cutting force in rotary ultrasonic machining (RUM) can help
   optimizing input variables. RUM of brittle materials has been
   investigated both experimentally and theoretically. However, there are
   no reports on cutting force models for RUM of brittle materials. This
   paper presents a mechanistic model for cutting force in RUM of brittle
   materials. Assuming that brittle fracture is the primary mechanism of
   material removal in RUM of brittle materials, the cutting force model is
   developed step by step. On the basis of this mechanistic model,
   relationships between cutting force and input variables (such as spindle
   speed, feed rate, ultrasonic vibration amplitude, abrasive size, and
   abrasive concentration) are predicted. Experiments are conducted for
   model verification and experimental results agree well with model
   predictions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a methodology for damage detection, location, and
   quantification based on vibration signature analysis and a comprehensive
   experimental study to assess the utility of the proposed structural
   health monitoring applied to a five-bay truss-type structure. The MUSIC
   algorithm introduced first by Jiang and Adeli for health monitoring of
   structures in 2007 is fused with artificial neural networks for an
   automated result. The developed methodology is based on feeding the
   amplitude of the natural frequencies as input of an artificial neural
   network, being the novelty of the proposed methodology its ability to
   identify, locate, and quantify the severity of damages with precision
   such as: external and internal corrosion and cracks in an automated
   monitoring process. Results show the proposed methodology is effective
   for detecting a healthy structure, a structure with external and
   internal corrosion, and a structure with crack. Therefore, the proposed
   fusion of MUSIC-ANN algorithms can be regarded as a simple, effective,
   and automated tool without requiring sophisticated equipment, toward
   establishing a practical and reliable structural health monitoring
   methodology, which will help to evaluate the condition of the structure,
   in order to detect damages early and to make the corresponding
   maintenance decisions in the structures.}},

Pages = {{167-174}},

Abstract = {{Acoustic emission signals originating from interlaminar crack
   propagation in fiber reinforced composites were recorded during double
   cantilever beam testing. The acoustic emission signals detected during
   testing were analyzed by feature based pattern recognition techniques.
   In previous studies it was demonstrated that the presented approach for
   detection of distinct types of acoustic emission signals is suitable.
   The subsequent correlation of distinct acoustic emission signal types to
   microscopic failure mechanisms is based on two procedures. Firstly, the
   frequency of occurrence of the distinct signal types is correlated to
   different specimens' fracture surface microstructure. Secondly, a
   comparison is made between experimental signals and signals resulting
   from finite element simulations based on a validated model for
   simulation of acoustic emission signals of typical failure mechanisms in
   fiber reinforced plastics. A distinction is made between fiber breakage,
   matrix cracking and interface failure. It is demonstrated, that the
   feature values extracted from simulated signals coincide well with those
   of experimental signals. As a result the applicability of the acoustic
   emission signal classification method for analysis of failure in carbon
   fiber and glass fiber reinforced plastics under mode-I loading
   conditions has been demonstrated. The quantification of matrix cracking,
   interfacial failure and fiber breakage was evaluated by interpretation
   of the obtained distributions of acoustic emission signals types in
   terms of fracture mechanics. The accumulated acoustic emission signal
   amplitudes show strong correlation to the mechanical properties of the
   specimens. Moreover, the changes in contribution to the different
   failure types explain the observed variation in failure behavior of the
   individual specimens quantitatively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights
