Abstract = {{Fatigue limit determination via the conventional Wohler-curve method is
   associated with extended experimental times as it requires testing of a
   large number of specimens. The current paper introduces a methodology
   for fast, reliable and experimentally economic determination of the
   fatigue limit in monolithic and composite materials by means of combined
   usage of two nondestructive inspection methods, namely infrared (IR)
   lock-in thermography and acoustic emission (AE). IR thermography, as a
   real-time and non-contact technique, allowed the detection of heat waves
   generated due to thermo-mechanical coupling as well as of the energy
   dissipated intrinsically during dynamic loading of the material. AE, on
   the other hand, was employed to record the transient waves resulting
   from crack propagation events. Aluminum grade 1050 H16 and cross-ply
   SiC/BMAS ceramic matrix composites were subjected to fatigue loading at
   various stress levels and were monitored by an IR camera and AE sensors.
   The fatigue limit of the monolithic material, obtained by the lock-in
   infrared thermography technique and supported by acoustic emission was
   found to be in agreement with measurements obtained by the conventional
   S-N curve method. The fatigue limit of the ceramic matrix composite was
   validated with acoustic emission data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Electrospinning core-shell nanofibers for interfacial toughening and

Abstract = {{This article reports a novel hybrid multiscale carbon-fiber/epoxy
   composite reinforced with self-healing core-shell nanofibers at
   interfaces. The ultrathin self-healing fibers were fabricated by means
   of coelectrospinning, in which liquid dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) as the
   healing agent was enwrapped into polyacrylonitrile (PAN) to form
   core-shell DCPD/PAN nanofibers. These core-shell nanofibers were
   incorporated at interfaces of neighboring carbon-fiber fabrics prior to
   resin infusion and formed into ultrathin self-healing interlayers after
   resin infusion and curing. The core-shell DCPD/PAN fibers are expected
   to function to self-repair the interfacial damages in composite
   laminates, e.g., delamination. Wet layup, followed by vacuum-assisted
   resin transfer molding (VARTM) technique, was used to process the
   proof-of-concept hybrid multiscale self-healing composite. Three-point
   bending test was utilized to evaluate the self-healing effect of the
   core-shell nanofibers on the flexural stiffness of the composite
   laminate after predamage failure. Experimental results indicate that the
   flexural stiffness of such novel self-healing composite after predamage
   failure can be completely recovered by the self-healing nanofiber
   interlayers. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was utilized for
   fractographical analysis of the failed samples. SEM micrographs clearly
   evidenced the release of healing agent at laminate interfaces and the
   toughening and self-healing mechanisms of the core-shell nanofibers.
   This study expects a family of novel high-strength, lightweight
   structural polymer composites with self-healing function for potential
   use in aerospace and aeronautical structures, sports utilities, etc. (c)

Abstract = {{Designing lightweight high-performance materials that can sustain high
   impulsive loadings is of great interest for marine applications. In this
   study, a finite element fluid-structure interaction model was developed
   to understand the deformation and failure mechanisms of both monolithic
   and sandwich composite panels. Fiber (E-glass fiber) and matrix
   (vinylester resin) damage and degradation in individual unidirectional
   composite laminas were modeled using Hashin failure model. The
   delamination between laminas was modeled by a strain-rate sensitive
   cohesive law. In sandwich panels, core compaction (H250 PVC foam) is
   modeled by a crushable foam plasticity model with volumetric hardening
   and strain-rate sensitivity. The model-predicted deformation histories,
   fiber/matrix damage patterns, and inter-lamina delamination, in both
   monolithic and sandwich composite panels, were compared with
   experimental observations. The simulations demonstrated that the
   delamination process is strongly rate dependent, and that Hashin model
   captures the spatial distribution and magnitude of damage to a
   first-order approximation. The model also revealed that the foam plays
   an important role in improving panel performance by mitigating the
   transmitted impulse to the back-side face sheet while maintaining
   overall bending stiffness. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental and modeling study of factors influencing intergranular
   corrosion (IGC) penetration depth into an Al-Mg alloy, AA5083 (UNS
   A95083), is presented. Potentiostatic tests over a range of potentials
   in 0.6 M sodium chloride (NaCl) solution were conducted on longitudinal
   by long transverse (LT), long transverse by short transverse (ST), and
   longitudinal by short transverse (LS) surfaces of sensitized AA5083. The
   IGC penetration rate was found to depend on applied potential, degree of
   sensitization (DoS), exposure time, and propagation direction relative
   to the rolling direction. Statistical IGC depth distributions were
   analyzed and served as inputs for a phenomenological model to estimate
   IGC damage progression for AA5083 during exposure to 0.6 M NaCl solution
   at pH 8.3. This model was validated by comparing the model predicted and
   experimental depths for the 100 degrees C sensitization condition.
   Extension of this combined experimental and modeling approach to the 80
   degrees C sensitization demonstrated that sensitization temperature is
   another significant factor in IGC penetration depths.}},

Abstract = {{The ductile damage mechanisms dominating in modern high-strength steels
   have emphasised the significance of the onset of damage and the
   subsequent damage evolution in sheet metal forming processes. This paper
   contributes to the modelling of the plasticity and ductile damage
   behaviour of a dual-phase steel sheet by proposing a new damage
   mechanics approach derived from the combination of different types of
   damage models. It addresses the influence of stress state on the
   plasticity behaviour and onset of damage of materials, and quantifies
   the microstructure degradation using a dissipation-energy-based damage
   evolution law. The model is implemented into ABAQUS/Explicit by means of
   a user material subroutine (VUMAT) and applied to the subsequent
   numerical simulations. A hybrid experimental and numerical approach is
   employed to calibrate the material parameters, and the detailed program
   is demonstrated. The calibrated parameters and the model are then
   verified by experiments at different levels, and a good agreement
   between the experimental and numerical results is achieved.}},

   nanocomposites}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{46-55}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Fly ash-based geopolymers are currently being considered as a viable
   replacement to ordinary Portland cement (OPC) due to multifold benefits
   such as cost efficiency, chemical stability, corrosion resistance, rapid
   strength gain rate, low shrinkage and freeze-thaw resistance. However,
   geopolymers tend to be more brittle than OPC and thus unsuitable for
   concrete structures due to safety concerns. Geopolymers with improved
   electrical properties can also be used as self-sensing materials capable
   of detect their own structural damage. Therefore, this paper is aimed at
   investigating the effect of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) on the
   mechanical and electrical properties of fly ash (FA) geopolymeric
   composites. Geopolymeric matrices containing different MWCNTs
   concentrations (0.0\%, 0.1\%, 0.5\% and 1.0\% by weight) were
   synthesized and their mechanical properties (i.e., flexural strength,
   Young's modulus, flexural toughness and fracture energy), electrical
   conductivity and piezoresistive response were determined. A scanning
   electron microscope (SEM) was employed to evaluate the distribution
   quality of MWCNTs within the matrix and determine their crack-bridging
   mechanism. The experimental results showed that the MWCNTs were
   uniformly distributed within the matrix at 0.1 and 0.5-wt\% and they
   were poorly distributed and severely agglomerated within the matrix at
   1-wt\%. The experimental results also showed that the addition of MWCNTs
   increased the flexural strength, Young's modulus and flexural toughness
   by as much as 160\%, 109\% and 275\%, respectively. The MWCNTs also
   enhanced the fracture energy and increased the electrical conductivity
   by 194\%. The geopolymeric nanocomposites exhibited a piezoresistive
   response with high sensitivity to micro-crack propagation. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new damage detection methodology for beams. It
   applies wavelet analysis to locate the damage from changes in the mode
   shapes (geometric based analysis). The proposed methodology requires the
   mode shapes of a reference undamaged state as well as those of the
   potentially damaged one. Once obtained, a continuous wavelet transform
   is applied to the difference of the mode shape vectors to obtain
   information of the changes in each of them. Finally, the results for
   each mode are added up to compute an overall result along the structure.
   For the addition, the wavelet coefficients of each mode are weighted
   according to the corresponding variation of the natural frequency. By
   doing so, emphasis is given on those modes that are more likely to be
   affected by damage. On the other hand, mode shapes that have not changed
   their natural frequencies are disregarded. The proposed methodology also
   includes mathematical techniques to avoid wavelet transform edge effect,
   experimental noise reduction in mode shapes and creation of new virtual
   measuring points. It has been validated by experimental analysis of
   steel beams with cracks of different sizes and at different locations.
   The results show that the method is sensitive to little damage. The
   paper analyses the severity threshold of damage and the required number
   of sensors to obtain successful results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

   representative 3D non-crimp orthogonal woven (3DNCOW) carbon/epoxy
   composite. The composite is tested under uniaxial in-plane tensile
   loading in the warp, fill and +/- 45 degrees bias directions. An
   ``S-shape{''} nonlinearity observed in the stress-strain curves is
   explained by the concurrent contributions of inherent carbon fiber
   stiffening ({''}non-Hookean behavior{''}), fiber straightening, and
   gradual damage accumulation. Several approaches to the determination of
   a single-value Young's modulus from a significantly nonlinear
   stress-strain curve are discussed and the best approach recommended.
   Also, issues related to the experimental determination of effective
   Poisson's ratios for this class of composites are discussed, and their
   possible resolution suggested. The observed experimental values of the
   warp- and fill-directional tensile strengths are much higher than those
   typically obtained for 3D interlock weave carbon/epoxy composites while
   the nonlinear material behavior observed for the +/- 45
   degrees-directional tensile loading is in a qualitative agreement with
   the earlier results for other textile composites. Results of the damage
   initiation and progression, monitoried by means of acoustic emission,
   full-field strain optical measurements, X-rays and optical microscopy,
   are illustrated and discussed in detail. The damage modes at different
   stages of the increasing tensile loading are analyzed, and the principal
   progressive damage mechanisms identified, including the characteristic
   crack patterns developed at each damage stage. It is concluded that
   significant damage initiation of the present material occurs in the same
   strain range as in traditional cross-ply laminates, while respective
   strain range for other previously studied carbon/epoxy textile
   composites is significantly lower. Overall the revealed advantages in
   stiffness, strength and progressive damage behavior of the studied
   composite are mainly attributed to the absence of crimp and only minimal
   fiber waviness in the reinforcing 3DNCOW preform. C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Fretting fatigue is a combination of two complex mechanical phenomena.
   Fretting appears between components that are subjected to small relative
   oscillatory motions. Once these connected components undergo cyclic
   fatigue load, fretting fatigue occurs. In general, fretting fatigue
   failure process can be divided into two main portions, namely crack
   initiation and crack propagation. Fretting fatigue crack initiation
   characteristics are very difficult to detect because damages such as
   micro-cracks are always hidden between two contact surfaces.
   In this paper Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) approach in conjunction
   with Finite Element Analyses (FEA) is used to find a predictor tool for
   fretting fatigue crack initiation lifetime. For this purpose an
   uncoupled damage evolution law is developed to model fretting fatigue
   crack initiation lifetime at various fretting condition such as contact
   geometry, axial stress, normal load and tangential load. The predicted
   results are validated with published experimental data from literature.

Abstract = {{With the development of high-strength materials, the existing fatigue
   strength formulae cannot satisfactorily describe the relation between
   fatigue strength sigma(w) and tensile strength sigma(b) of metallic
   materials with a wide range of strength. For a simple but more precise
   prediction, the tensile and fatigue properties of SAE 4340 steel with
   the tensile strengths ranging from 1290 MPa to 2130 MPa obtained in
   virtue of different tempering temperatures were studied in this paper.
   Based on the experimental results of SAE 4340 steel and numerous other
   data available (conventional and newly developed materials), through
   introducing a sensitive factor of defects P, a new universal fatigue
   strength formula sigma(w)=sigma(b)(C-P.sigma(b)) was established for the
   first time. Combining the variation tendency of fatigue crack initiation
   sites and the competition of defects, the fatigue damage mechanisms
   associated with different tensile strengths and cracking sites are
   explained well. The decrease in the fatigue strength at high-strength
   level can be explained by fracture mechanics and attributed to the
   transition of fatigue cracking sites from surface to the inner
   inclusions, resulting in the maximum fatigue strength sigma(max)(w) at
   an appropriate tensile strength level. Therefore, the universal fatigue
   strength formula cannot only explain why many metallic materials with
   excessively high strength do not display high fatigue strength, but also
   provide a new clue for designing the materials or eliminating the
   processing defects of the materials. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The tensile-tensile fatigue behavior of unidirectional C/SiC ceramic
   matrix composites at room and elevated temperature has been
   investigated. An approach to estimate the interface shear stress of
   ceramic matrix composites under fatigue loading has been developed.
   Based on the damage mechanisms of fiber sliding relative to matrix in
   the interface debonded region upon unloading and subsequent reloading,
   the unloading interface reverse slip length and reloading interface new
   slip length are determined by the fracture mechanics approach. The
   hysteresis loss energy for the strain energy lost per volume during
   corresponding cycle is formulatd in terms of interface shear stress. By
   comparing the experimental hysteresis loss energy with the computational
   values, the interface shear stress of unidirectional C/SiC ceramic
   composites corresponding to different cycles at room and elevated
   temperatures has been predicted.}},
