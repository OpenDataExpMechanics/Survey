Abstract = {{Modal curvatures have been widely used in the detection of structural
   damage. Attractive features of modal curvature include great sensitivity
   to damage and instant determination of damage location. However, an
   intrinsic deficiency in a modal curvature is its susceptibility to the
   measurement noise present in the displacement mode shape that produces
   the modal curvature, likely obscuring the features of damage. To address
   this deficiency, the Teager energy operator together with wavelet
   transform is tactically utilized to treat modal curvature, producing a
   new modal curvature, termed the Teager energy operator-wavelet transform
   modal curvature. This new modal curvature features distinct capabilities
   of suppressing noise, canceling global trends, and intensifying the
   singular feature caused by damage for a measured mode shape involving
   noise. These features maximize the sensitivity to damage and accuracy of
   damage localization. The proposed modal curvature is demonstrated in
   several analytical cases of cracked pinned-pinned, clamped-free and
   clamped-clamped beams, with emphasis on characterizing damage in noisy
   conditions, and it is further validated by an experimental program using
   a scanning laser vibrometer to acquire mode shapes of a cracked aluminum
   beam. The Teager energy operator-wavelet transform modal curvature
   essentially overcomes the deficiency of conventional modal curvature,
   providing a new dynamic feature well suited for damage characterization
   in noisy environments. (The Matlab code for implementing Teager energy
   operator-wavelet transform modal curvature can be provided by the

Abstract = {{The scales of the arapaima (Arapaima gigas), one of the largest
   freshwater fish in the world, can serve as inspiration for the design of
   flexible dermal armor. Each scale is composed of two layers: a laminate
   composite of parallel collagen fibrils and a hard, highly mineralized
   surface layer. We review the structure of the arapaima scales and
   examine the functions of the different layers, focusing on the
   mechanical behavior, including tension and penetration of the scales,
   with and without the highly mineralized outer layer. We show that the
   fracture of the mineral and the stretching, rotation and delamination of
   collagen fibrils dissipate a significant amount of energy prior to
   catastrophic failure, providing high toughness and resistance to
   penetration by predator teeth. We show that the arapaima's scale has
   evolved to minimize damage from penetration by predator teeth through a
   Bouligand-like arrangement of successive layers, each consisting of
   parallel collagen fibrils with different orientations. This inhibits
   crack propagation and restricts damage to an area adjoining the
   penetration. The flexibility of the lamellae is instrumental to the
   redistribution of the compressive stresses in the underlying tissue,
   decreasing the severity of the concentrated load produced by the action
   of a tooth. The experimental results, combined with small-angle Xray
   scattering characterization and molecular dynamics simulations, provide
   a complete picture of the mechanisms of deformation, delamination and
   rotation of the lamellae during tensile extension of the scale. (C) 2014

Title = {{An extended GTN model for ductile fracture under high and low stress
   triaxiality}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{54}},
Pages = {{193-228}},

Abstract = {{This contribution provides an improvement on GTN model upon the
   prediction of fracture location within low level of stress triaxiality.
   In the proposition, two distinct damage parameters are introduced as
   internal variables of the degradation process and an effective damage is
   calculated as a sum of both contributions in the post-processed step. In
   the beginning, the volume void fraction, based on conservation mass law,
   is assumed as the first damage parameter, similar to Gurson's original
   model. This volumetric damage contribution is able to capture spherical
   void growth, which plays the main role in tensile loading condition. The
   second damage parameter is proposed as a new shear mechanism, based on
   geometrical and phenomenological aspects and is also a function of the
   equivalent plastic strain, Lode angle and stress triaxiality. The shear
   damage parameter is formulated independent of the volume void fraction
   and requires a new nucleation of micro-defects mechanism to trigger the
   shear growth contribution, and hence is able to capture elongated (and
   rotation) void growth which is present in simple shear and combined
   shear/tensile or shear/compression loading conditions. Furthermore, the
   first and the second damage parameters are coupled in the yield function
   in order to affect the hydrostatic stress and deviatoric stress
   contributions, separately. In the first part of this paper, a review of
   Gurson's model and its most famous version as GTN's model is done. After
   that, the new contribution is presented and an implicit numerical
   integration algorithm is determined, based on the operator split
   methodology. The calibration strategy is discussed for determination of
   material parameters. Numerical tests are performed for a butterfly
   specimen using two types of materials (aluminum alloy 2024-T351 and
   steel 1045) under ranges of stress triaxiality between-1/3 < eta < 1/3
   (shear/compression or shear/tensile). At the end, the behavior of
   internal variables is analyzed, such as: evolution of both damage
   parameters, evolution of the equivalent plastic strain, the reaction
   curve and the contour of the effective damage parameter. The results
   obtained are compared with experimental data and have shown that the
   present formulation performs well in the prediction of the fracture
   location and determination of the correct level of equivalent plastic
   strain at fracture under predominant shear loading condition. (C) 2013

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{199-212}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{A continuum damage mechanics (CDM) based constitutive model has been
   developed to describe elastic, plastic and damage behavior of porous
   rocks. The pressure sensitive inelastic deformation of porous rocks
   together with their damage mechanisms are studied for drained and
   undrained conditions. Fracture mechanics of microcrack and micro-void
   nucleation and their coalescence are incorporated into the formulation
   of the CDM models to accurately capture different failure modes of
   rocks. A fracture mechanics based failure criterion is also incorporated
   to accurately capture the post fracture crack advances in the case of
   progressive failures. The performance of the developed elastoplastic and
   CDM models are compared with the available experimental data and then
   the models are introduced into a commercial software package through
   user-defined subroutines. The hydraulic fractures growth in a reservoir
   rock is then investigated; in which the effect of injection pressure is
   studied and the simulations are compared with the available solutions in
   the literature. The developed CDM model outperforms the traditional
   fracture mechanics approaches by removing stress singularities at the
   fracture tips and simulation of progressive fractures without any
   essential need for remeshing. This model would provide a robust tool for
   modeling hydraulic fracture growth using conventional elements of FEA
   with a computational cost less than similar computational techniques
   like cohesive element methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENDODONTICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{9}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: The aim of the present study was to investigate the
   incidence of cracks in root dentin after root canal preparation with
   ProTaper Next (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland), HyFlex
   (Coltene-Whaledent, Allstetten, Switzerland), and ProTaper Universal
   (Dentsply Maillefer) rotary instruments. Methods: One-hundred mandibular
   premolars were selected. Twenty-five teeth were left unprepared and
   served as a negative control; another 25 teeth were in-strumented with
   the ProTaper Universal system up to size F4 as a positive control, and
   the remaining 50 teeth were shaped with the following experimental
   groups with an apical size 40 file: ProTaper Next X4 and HyFlex 40/0.4.
   After root canal preparation, all of the roots were sectioned
   perpendicular to the long axis at 2, 4, 6, and 8 mm from the apex, and
   the sections were then observed under a stereomicroscope. The
   absence/presence of cracks was recorded, and the data were analyzed with
   a chi-square test. The significance level was set at P = .05. Results:
   No cracks were observed in the negative control group. Vertical root
   fractures were not observed in any of the groups. The ProTaper Next and
   HyFlex instruments caused fewer cracks (28\%) than the ProTaper
   Universal instrument (56\%) (P < .05). However, there were no
   significant differences in crack formation between the ProTaper Next and
   HyFlex groups (P > .05). Conclusions: Within the limitations of this in
   vitro study, all of the instrumentation systems used in this study
   created cracks in the root dentin. The ProTaper Next and HyFlex
   instruments tended to cause fewer dentinal cracks compared with the
   ProTaper Universal instrument.}},

Abstract = {{Fracture in metal forming can occur in three different modes: (i)
   tensile; (ii) in-plane shear; and (iii) out-of-plane shear (respectively
   the same as modes 1, II and III of fracture mechanics). The
   circumstances under which each mode will occur are identified in terms
   of plastic flow and microstructural ductile damage by means of an
   analytical framework to characterize fracture loci under plane stress
   conditions that also takes anisotropy into consideration.
   Experimental results retrieved from the literature give support to the
   presentation and show that plastic flow and failure in sheet forming
   results from competition between modes I and II whereas in bulk forming
   fracture results from competition between modes I and III. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{We study the genesis and the selective propagation of complex crack
   networks induced by thermal shock or drying of brittle materials. We use
   a quasistatic gradient damage model to perform large-scale numerical
   simulations showing that the propagation of fully developed cracks
   follows Griffith criterion and depends only on the fracture toughness,
   while crack morphogenesis is driven by the material's internal length.
   Our numerical simulations feature networks of parallel cracks and
   selective arrest in two dimensions and hexagonal columnar joints in
   three dimensions, without any hypotheses on cracks geometry, and are in
   good agreement with available experimental results.}},

Title = {{Thin ply composites: Experimental characterization and modeling of
   size-effects}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{121-132}},
Month = {{SEP 12}},
Abstract = {{Thin-ply composites are rapidly gaining interest in the composite
   industry, not only because of the larger design possibilities that they
   offer, but also because of positive size effects that have been shown to
   improve performance in various loading conditions {[}1]. In this work,
   carbon fiber-epoxy composites of different ply thicknesses (30-300
   g/m(2) fiber areal weight) were produced from the same batch of Toray
   M40JB fiber and NorthTPT TP80ep matrix to study the influence of ply
   thickness on the ultimate strength and on the onset of damage in lamina,
   laminates and components. Uniaxial tension, open-hole compression and
   open-hole tensile fatigue tests on quasi isotropic {[}45 degrees/90
   degrees/-45 degrees/0 degrees](ns) laminates showed very significant
   improvements regarding the on-set of damage, and in some cases ultimate
   strength, when decreasing the ply thickness. These performance
   improvements are the result of major changes in the damage progression
   and failure modes of the laminates caused by a systematic delay or near
   suppression of transverse cracking and delamination growth in thin-ply
   composites. On the component level, thin-ply laminates enabled a marked
   improvement for bolted-joint bearing, especially in hot-wet conditions.
   Under impact, the 30 mu m thin ply laminate exhibited a quasi-brittle
   failure with extensive translaminar cracking while a ply thickness of
   100 mu m was found as optimum to minimize the projected damage area. Ply
   thickness scaling of transverse and in-plane shear strength was
   identified based on classical laminate theory and unnotched tensile
   tests on quasi-isotropic specimens. The empirical scaling was found to
   follow a linear trend over a range of ply thicknesses from 30 to 250 mu
   m. Due to the near suppression of delamination, the strength of thin-ply
   composites could then be modeled more effectively than thick ply
   composites using classical laminate theory or standard multilayer shell
   modeling. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{313}},
Pages = {{67-75}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Subsurface damages and surface roughness are the two significant
   parameters which determine the efficiency of optical components. In this
   study, a cup diamond wheel is used in grinding process of the specimens
   made of Zerodur (R) glass-ceramic, to investigate the influences of
   grinding parameters on the SSD and SR. The grinding parameters used in
   this study are depth of cut, cutting speed and feed rate; and effects of
   these parameters are studied. The experimental results are compared with
   the modified model of Lambropoulos, proposed by Li, and a good
   accordance is observed between them. Two measuring techniques were used
   to study the SSD. Cross-sectional polishing method and angle polishing
   method; the first one, suitable for studying the material removal
   mechanism and the other one convenient for examining the depth of
   subsurface damages and distribution of micro-cracks in the ground
   surface, respectively. A novel technique is introduced to measure the
   cracks length in which the sum of all cracks in a specific area of a SEM
   micrograph is calculated by image processing method and regarded as a
   factor to study the cracks length. Also, a statistical model is
   developed in order to predict the surface roughness and a good agreement
   is observed between the experimental results and the predicted values.

Title = {{Guided Wave Damage Characterization via Minimum Variance Imaging with a
   Distributed Array of Ultrasonic Sensors}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NONDESTRUCTIVE EVALUATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{299-308}},

Abstract = {{Guided wave imaging with a distributed array of inexpensive transducers
   offers a fast and cost-efficient means for damage detection and
   localization in plate-like structures such as aircraft and spacecraft
   skins. As such, this technology is a natural choice for inclusion in
   condition-based maintenance and integrated structural health management
   programs. One of the implementation challenges results from the complex
   interaction of propagating ultrasonic waves with both the interrogation
   structure and potential defects or damage. For example, a guided
   ultrasonic wave interacts with a surface or sub-surface defect
   differently depending on the angle of incidence, defect size and
   orientation, excitation frequency, and guided wave mode. However, this
   complex interaction also provides a mechanism for guided wave imaging
   algorithms to perform damage characterization in addition to damage
   detection and localization. Damage characterization provides a mechanism
   to help discriminate actual damage (e.g. fatigue cracks) from benign
   changes, and can be used with crack propagation models to estimate
   remaining life. This work proposes the use of minimum variance imaging
   to perform damage detection, localization, and characterization.
   Scattering assumptions used to perform damage characterization are
   obtained through both analytical and finite element models. Experimental
   data from an in situ distributed array are used to demonstrate
   feasibility of this approach using a through-hole and two
   through-thickness notches of different orientations to simulate damage
   in an aluminum plate.}},
