Abstract = {{Ductile fracture is often considered as the consequences of the
   accumulation of plastic damage. This paper is concerned with the
   application of a recently developed damage plasticity theory
   incorporates the pressure sensitivity and the Lode angle dependence into
   a nonlinear damage rule and the material deterioration. The ductile
   damaging process is calculated through the so-called ``cylindrical
   decomposition{''} method. The constitutive equations are discussed and
   numerically implemented. An experimental and numerical investigation for
   three-point bending tests is reported for aluminum alloy 2024-T351.
   Crack initiation and propagation in compact tension specimens are also
   studied numerically. These simulation results show good agreement with
   experiments. The present model can successfully predict slant fracture
   as well as the formation of shear lips. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper describes the mechanical effects of rust layer formed in

   morphological and physico-chemical properties (composition, structures)

   dispersive spectroscopy. The corrosion pattern was mainly characterized
   by a rust layer confined at the interface between the steel and the

   rust thickness and the Faraday's law. Furthermore, in order to
   understand the mechanical effects of corrosion on the damage of mortar,
   displacement field measurements were obtained by using digital image
   correlation. An analytical model (hollow cylinder subjected to inner and

Abstract = {{The dynamic behavior of composite laminates is very complex because
   there are many concurrent phenomena during composite laminate failure
   under impact load. Fiber breakage, delaminations, matrix cracking,
   plastic deformations due to contact and large displacements are some
   effects which should be considered when a structure made from composite
   material is impacted by a foreign object. Thus, an investigation of the
   low velocity impact on laminated composite thin disks of epoxy resin
   reinforced by carbon fiber is presented. The influence of stacking
   sequence and energy impact was investigated using load-time histories,
   displacement-time histories and energy-time histories as well as images
   from NDE. Indentation tests results were compared to dynamic results,
   verifying the inertia effects when thin composite laminate was impacted
   by foreign object with low velocity. Finite element analysis (FEA) was
   developed, using Hill's model and material models implemented by UMAT
   (User Material Subroutine) into software ABAQUS (TM), in order to
   simulate the failure mechanisms under indentation tests. (C) 2007

Abstract = {{Extensive fatigue experiments were conducted using 7075-T651 aluminum
   alloy under uniaxial, torsion, and axial-torsion loading. Detailed
   fatigue results were reported. Different mean stresses were applied in
   the experiments and the mean stress was found to have a significant
   influence on the fatigue strength of the material. A tensile mean stress
   decreased the fatigue strength dramatically. Fatigue damage was found to
   occur under compression-compression loading. In addition, axial-torsion
   experiments using tubular specimens were conducted under different
   loading paths to study the multiaxial fatigue behavior. Fatigue cracking
   behavior was found to be dependent on the loading path as well as the
   loading magnitude. When the loading magnitude was high, the material
   displayed shear cracking. When the loading stress was below a certain
   level, the material exhibited tensile cracking. For most loading cases
   under investigation, the material displayed a mixed cracking behavior. A
   kink was found in the shear strain versus fatigue life curve from the
   pure torsion experiments, and it was associated with a distinctive
   transition of cracking behavior. The Smith-Watson-Topper (SWT) parameter
   with a critical plane interpretation was found to correlate well with
   most of the experiments conducted in terms of fatigue lives. However,
   the SWT parameter cannot deal with the uniaxial fatigue conditions where
   the maximum stress is low or negative. More importantly, the model fails
   to correctly predict the cracking behavior observed experimentally on
   the material. A critical plane criterion based on a combination of the
   normal and shear components of the stresses and strains on material
   planes was found to better correlate the fatigue experiments in terms of
   both fatigue life and cracking behavior. The characteristics of the
   multiaxial fatigue criterion were discussed based on the experimental
   observations on 7075-T651 aluminum alloy. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All

   into account the Schmid factor and the normal stress in relation to the
   elastic anisotropy of the alpha-phase. Finally, the spatial distribution

Abstract = {{In this work, an accurate and suitable data reduction scheme is
   developed to measure the fracture energy of adhesive joints under pure

   propagation, which can introduce non-negligible errors on the fracture
   energy measurements. Moreover, it accounts for the fracture process zone
   effects which can be significant when ductile adhesives are used. The
   new method was compared to classical data reduction schemes and was
   validated numerically using a trapezoidal mixed-mode cohesive damage
   model. The fracture characterization in mode I using a developed
   trapezoidal cohesive damage model is performed by an inverse method.
   Excellent agreement between the numerical and experimental R-curves was

Abstract = {{This paper describes a combined fracture-plastic model for concrete.
   Tension is handled by a fracture model, based on the classical
   orthotropic smeared crack formulation and the crack band approach. It
   employs the Rankine failure criterion, exponential softening, and it can
   be used as a rotated or a fixed crack model. The plasticity model for
   concrete in compression is based on the Menetrey-Willam failure surface,
   the plastic volumetric strain as a hardening/softening parameter and a
   non-associated flow rule based on a nonlinear plastic potential
   function. Both models use a return-mapping algorithm for the integration
   of constitutive equations. Special attention is given to the development
   of an algorithm for the combination of the two models. The suggested
   combination algorithm is based on a recursive substitution, and it
   allows for the two models to be developed and formulated separately. The
   algorithm can handle cases when failure surfaces of both models are
   active, but also when physical changes such as crack closure occur. The
   model can be used to simulate concrete cracking, crushing under high
   confinement and crack closure due to crushing in other material
   directions. The model is integrated in a general finite element package
   ATENA and its performance is evaluated by comparisons with various
   experimental results from the literature. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

   cantilever beam test applied to fracture characterization of wood in
   mode I. A new data reduction scheme based on the beam theory and
   specimen compliance is proposed in order to overcome the difficulties
   inherent to crack monitoring during propagation. A cohesive damage model
   adapted to wood is used to simulate the test. The cohesive properties
   are evaluated using an inverse method based on a developed Genetic
   Algorithm through an optimisation strategy. The results demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed methodology as a suitable data reduction
   scheme for the double cantilever beam test. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Experimental measurements of permeability evolution during triaxial

   fluid flow in fault zones}},

Abstract = {{Detailed experimental studies of the development of permeability of
   crustal rock during deformation are essential in helping to understand
   fault mechanics and constrain larger-scale models that predict bulk
   fluid flow within the crust. Permeability is particularly enhanced in
   the damage zone of faults, where microfracture damage accumulates under
   stress less than that required for macroscopic failure. Experiments
   performed in the prefailure region can provide data directly applicable
   to these zones of microfracture damage surrounding faults. The strength,
   permeability, and pore fluid volume evolution of initially intact
   crystalline rocks (Cerro Cristales granodiorite and Westerly granite)
   under increasing differential load leading to macroscopic failure has
   been determined at water pore pressures of 50 MPa and varying effective
   pressures from 10 to 50 MPa. Permeability is seen to increase by up to,
   and over, 2 orders of magnitude prior to macroscopic failure, with the
   greatest increase seen at lowest effective pressures. Postfailure
   permeability is shown to be over 3 orders of magnitude higher than
   initial intact permeabilities and approaches the lower limit of
   predicted in situ bulk crustal permeabilities. Increasing amplitude
   cyclic loading tests show permeability-stress hysteresis, with high
   permeabilities maintained as differential stress is reduced and the
   greatest permeability increases are seen between 90 and 99\% of the
   failure stress. Prefailure permeabilities are nearly 7 to 9 orders of
   magnitude lower than that predicted by some high-pressure diffusive
   models suggesting that if these models are correct, microfracture matrix
   flow cannot dominate, and that bulk fluid flow must be dominated by
   larger-scale structures such as macrofractures. We present a model,
   based on our data, in which the permeability of a highly stressed fault
   tip process zone in low-permeability crystalline rocks increases by more
   than 2 orders of magnitude. Stress reduction related to the onward
   migration of the fault tip close damage zone cracks, while some
   permeability is maintained due to hysteresis from permanent
   microfracture damage.}},

Abstract = {{A series of tensile tests on scaled quasi-isotropic laminates have been
   carried out and modelled using finite element analysis to predict
   failure. Observations during testing and examination of the failed test
   specimens showed significant influence of matrix cracking and
   delamination on the final failure. Initially the virtual crack closure
   technique (VCCT) was used to determine the applied load that would cause
   free edge delamination. Experimental results showed that failure
   occurred at loads lower than those predicted. Matrix cracks, observed in
   the testing, were introduced into the model and interface elements were
   used to model the delamination development. This approach gave good
   correlation to the behaviour observed in the tests. Even in the
   specimens apparently dominated by fibre failure, delamination was shown
   to be significant. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},
