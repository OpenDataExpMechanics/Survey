Experimental data availability is a cornerstone to scientific research. Building  on  existing  research, replicating  research  and  extending  on  research  is  fundamental, especially in the domain of experimental mechanics.  With this  work, we study the availability of experimental data from 2000 to 2016. The  most cited research per year related to the field of  experimental damage  was  identified from the  Web of Science  scientific repository and analyzed for the  presence of an e-mail contact address.  A short survey on the availability and  willingness  to  share  the  underlying  research  data  was  sent  to  the  original  researchers.  Answers were analyzed and 37 out of 187 researchers replied.  Only  11  researchers  were  willing  to  share  the  raw  experimental  data  and  could still access it.  A  number  of  issues  with  the  availability  of  the  experimental  data  are  identified and discussed.  Two main issues are characterized as follows.  First,  e-mail addresses are insufficient for long term availability because 42 were notexistent any more.  Second, some reported lacking storage space to archive large data sets.

## Descripton of data

In the subfolder [data](https://github.com/OpenDataExpMechanics/Survey/tree/master/data) the 11 articles per year (2000-2016), which were utilized in the study, are stored in the bibtex format. In the folder [data/WoS_export](https://github.com/OpenDataExpMechanics/Survey/tree/master/data/WoS_export) the raw exported from Web of Science is stored.
